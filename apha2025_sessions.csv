"1399 Review of Phenoconversion Research for CYP2C19, 2C9, 2B6, and 3A4/5 in Pharmacogenomics and Clinical Practice",2025-03-21,,,,"Phenoconversion occurs when the activity status of an individual’s metabolizer gene is altered due to drug-gene interactions, disease states, or other clinically relevant interactions. Phenoconverted metabolizers can lose or gain enzyme functionality and lead to inappropriate drug dosing and toxicity. Currently, there is a tool that uses a patient’s active medication to inform their CYP2D6 activity. However, there is limited research on other clinically actionable pharmacogenes. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the current state of phenoconversion research for CYP2C19, 2C9, 2B6, and 3A4/5 genes and propose clinical implementation strategies."
1024 Patterns of infections with induction therapy among pediatric kidney transplant patients.,2025-03-21,,,,"Induction therapy use in pediatric kidney transplant population is still controversial. In 2021, around 94% of pediatric kidney transplant recipients received some induction therapy. Although this therapy is salient to prevent acute rejection of the newly transplanted kidney, it suppresses the immune system and significantly increases the risk of bacterial and viral infections. There is no optimal induction therapy regimen in pediatric population who undergo kidney transplants. Each transplant center sets its induction therapy protocol and regimens trying to balance the benefits of acute rejection prevention and the risks of infections. Recently, infections have become the leading cause of hospitalization after kidney transplants in the pediatric population. CMV infection increases the risk of graft rejection and EBV infection is the main risk factor of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. UTI is considered the most common infection after transplant. There is a need in clinical practice to determine the risk of CMV, EBV, and UTI infection that is associated with different induction therapy agents in pediatric patients after kidney transplants. This study aims to 1) describe the pattern of induction therapy use in pediatric kidney transplant patients, and 2) describe the pattern of viral and bacterial infections within the first year after discharge in pediatric kidney transplant patients."

1323 Evaluating web-based vaccine location finders for patients living in rural counties of South Carolina,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Question: Is distance to vaccine sites a potential barrier for patients living in rural areas of South Carolina seeking respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza and/or COVID-19 vaccines?

Background: Vaccination rates in South Carolina often lag behind national comparators for several adult vaccines. While there are numerous contributing factors, one determinant may be the distance required to obtain the vaccine, especially in rural areas. Web-based vaccine locators (e.g. vaccines.gov) have been established to aid patients and providers in identifying local sites with available vaccines.

Aims: To identify distance to available sites providing RSV, influenza, and/or COVID-19 vaccines for adults living in rural communities in South Carolina; to evaluate distribution of types of sites (e.g., independent pharmacies) most readily accessible."

After implementing a discharge alert for post-surgical patients, the impact on opioid refills within the 30-day post-discharge period remained unclear."

These efforts are being led and coordinated by the state’s professional, regulatory and academic pharmacy organizations.

The Tennessee Pharmacy Law Consortium, consisting of the six pharmacy law faculty members from the six pharmacy programs in the state of Tennessee, began to examine the legislative, regulatory and academic strides taken to forward the practice of pharmacy, as well as identifying the top priorities facing the profession today. 

A survey of Tennessee pharmacy laws, regulations, and issues is being coordinated by the Consortium.  Working with our strong state pharmacy organization, Tennessee Pharmacists Association (TPA), an active and focused board, Tennessee Board of Pharmacy, and other Tennessee agencies and organizations, the Consortium will examine the significant changes that have occurred within the state post-pandemic as well as identify the top legislative, regulatory, and professional priorities continuing to face our citizens and our profession."

There are approximately 11 million adults in the United States who live with COPD. In North Carolina, the number of adults diagnosed with COPD has climbed to 627,532 which is approximately 7% of the state's population. The American Lung Association (ALA) estimates that approximately $50 billion annually is spent on COPD medications and cost of therapy is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in COPD patients. Barriers to medication adherence may include living in a rural community, income level, and education level."

1314 Student Pharmacists as Reproductive Health Champions (SPARC): Igniting Pharmacist-Initiated Hormonal Contraception in Community-based Settings,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objectives of this project are to: (1) implement student pharmacist champions at select community-based pharmacy sites and (2) evaluate outcomes related to initiation of pharmacist-prescribed hormonal contraception services, including student perception, pharmacist perception, and patients reached. In 2021, legislation was passed within North Carolina to permit qualified pharmacists to dispense, deliver or administer oral or transdermal contraception following a patient assessment. A three-hour online continuing education program is required via the law to be completed by the pharmacist providing these services. Despite availability of training, service adoption is not yet at an ideal state to meet public health needs. Implementation of hormonal contraception services by pharmacists may be challenging without additional support. Trained student pharmacist champions could serve as ambassadors for reproductive health access and help service implementation within community-based pharmacies."
1083 Evaluating the Impact of Pharmacist-Delivered Educational Intervention on the Willingness to Receive HPV Vaccine in a Dental Clinic in New York,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Julian Azzouzi, PharmD, Touro College of Pharmacy (New York, NY) was one of four recipients of the APhA 2024 Impacting Immunization Implementation Through Quality Improvement Grant, supported by Merck. Background: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections are the leading cause of oral and oropharyngeal cancers (OOPC) in the U.S., accounting for 70% of new diagnoses. An estimated 90% of newly diagnosed HPV-attributed cancer cases could be preventable with HPV vaccination prior to exposure, as the vaccine is 100% effective for at least 12 years. Collaboration between dentists and pharmacists to enhance patient-centered care and vaccine education holds significant potential to increase HPV vaccine rates among persons aged 9-26. Current literature exploring interprofessional collaboration between dentists and pharmacists suggests this partnership may address gaps in patient care, although examples of HPV vaccine initiatives are limited. Objective: To assess the impact of screening dental patients' HPV vaccine status and providing pharmacist-led education and counseling on the willingness of patients or guardians to receive the HPV vaccine."
1233 The Impact of Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) on Patient Care and Patient Access to Independent Community Pharmacies: Saving Patients� Lives While Op,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Description
Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) are companies that manage prescription drug benefits for health insurance companies, Medicare Part D drug plans, self-insured employers, and other payers, such as state Medicaid programs.1 PBMs were originally created to function as processors of prescription drug claims. As the pharmaceutical industry has evolved, the role of PBMs has evolved with it. Today, PBMs function as middlemen between drug manufacturers, payers, and pharmacies to negotiate prices with drug manufacturers and pharmacies on behalf of payers.1

Project Objectives
Review and analyze the detrimental impact of PBM negotiated reimbursements and DIR fees on pharmacy operations and patient care outcomes.
Review the impact of anti-competitive practices of PBMs on limiting independent pharmacy access to patients by via vertical integration to in-network pharmacies."
1092 Impact of Pharmacist-led Education on New York Dental Provider�s Attitudes Towards Immunizations Practices,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to assess whether a pharmacist-delivered continuing education (CE) lecture will have an impact on the willingness and confidence of New York State dental providers in administering vaccines and allowing pharmacists to provide vaccinations in dental settings. The secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of this educational lecture on providers' personal beliefs about vaccinations.  Vaccinations are pivotal in preventing diseases such as human papillomavirus (HPV), influenza, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the community setting, pharmacists provide vital immunization services and offer vaccine-related guidance. Pharmacists’ involvement in providing vaccinations is well-established, while dental offices, frequently visited by patients, provide an ideal setting for vaccine education and potential administration. Although several states have expanded the scope of dental providers to provide vaccinations for patients, New York State currently does not give dental providers this authority. Dental providers and pharmacists typically operate independently, though both serve key public health roles. To our knowledge, studies recognizing the benefits of pharmacist-delivered vaccine education for dental providers are not well documented. Additionally, literature identifying opportunities for pharmacists to collaborate with dental providers to promote or administer vaccinations in dental settings is currently limited."
1395 Pharmacy Academia Leads Practice Innovation in Clinical Trials Diversity,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Achieving adequate representation of racial and ethnic minority populations (REMPs) in clinical trials is a major challenge in clinical research. Literature indicates that this lack of representation is driven by various factors, including patient, system, and provider barriers; mistrust; social determinants of health; failure to meet eligibility criteria; and lack of awareness. The investigators are developing the Pharmacy Advances Clinical Trials (PACT) Network, a strategic model aimed at increasing diversity in clinical trials by increasing awareness and knowledge, reducing barriers, and enhancing attitudes. This model unites pharmacy academia, community pharmacists, and community-based organizations to engage with REMPs to address underrepresentation in clinical research.

Each component of the PACT Network plays a vital role in achieving the network’s aims. The highly accessible nature of community pharmacists makes them a logical access point for REMPs, and community-based organizations can help to build and maintain trust with these populations. The network aims to leverage the strengths of academic pharmacy to convene key partners (e.g., community pharmacists and community-based organizations), support training of these partners, and coordinate intervention activities. To determine activities that should be pursued by the PACT Network, investigators needed to assess pharmacy academia’s current involvement in diversifying clinical trial participation, so an environmental scan was conducted. The objective of this study is to assess the activities of pharmacy academia aimed at enhancing diversity in clinical trial participation through identification of activity characteristics and related effective strategies and partnerships. This work was supported by the FDA Office of Minority Health and Health Equity and the Genentech Foundation."
1065 Student-pharmacist delivered reproductive health seminars improve college students� reproductive health knowledge and safe sex behaviors.,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The study objectives were to evaluate the educational value of a reproductive health and safe sex behavior seminar to college students, quantify improved reproductive health knowledge and changes in sex behaviors, and increase advocacy for pharmacist-prescribed contraception. A Healthy People 2030 goal is to decrease the 41.6% unintended pregnancy rate, which is high (51.1%) among women 20-24 years old. Women who experience unintended pregnancies are more likely to delay their prenatal care, endure mental health problems, and drop out of school. The dropout rate is 65% higher in women who have children during college compared to those who do not. Additionally, reproductive health literacy is low among college students. Preventing any unintended pregnancy will improve women’s and children's short and long-term health consequences. Pharmacists play an essential role in this public health initiative by increasing reproductive health knowledge and contraception access. Pharmacy-delivered college sex education programs could improve reproductive health knowledge that could increase safe sex behaviors with the ultimate goal to decrease unintended pregnancies."

1246 Assessing the feasibility of pharmacist-led remote blood pressure monitoring during the postpartum period,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This study aims to assess the feasibility of implementing a pharmacist-led remote blood pressure monitoring during the postpartum period. 52% of maternal deaths occur up to one year postpartum with high blood pressure and other cardiovascular conditions being among the top ten causes. Postpartum visits are essential because they can help detect postpartum hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) earlier and potentially reduce the hospital readmission rate, however, many women do not attend their postpartum follow-up visits. Remote blood pressure monitoring (RBPM) is a form of telehealth that has been proven to improve blood control and increase adherence to follow-up visits. Physicians and nurses primarily conduct RBPM, however, pharmacists are in a position also to provide these services. Having pharmacists more heavily integrated into maternal health care, more specifically during the postpartum period, could potentially help reduce maternal morbidity and mortality related to postpartum hypertensive disorders of pregnancy."
1028 Retrospective Case Control Study of Vitamin D Deficiency and Hemoglobin A1c Values Among Adults with Prediabetes,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"We assessed low vitamin D serum concentrations at the time of diagnosis of prediabetes and the subsequent development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) up to 10 years later. Prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7-6.4%) with concurrent vitamin D deficiency (serum 25(OH)D concentration <20 ng/mL) is associated with a higher risk of developing T2D (HbA1c >6.4%) than vitamin D sufficiency. In the US, underrepresented populations have a higher proportion of severe vitamin D deficiency, as shown among Black non-Latine (65%) and Latine (29%) adults compared with White non-Latine adults (14%). Treatment of vitamin D deficiency with vitamin D replacement is effective, inexpensive, and accessible. Furthermore, Black non-Latine and Latine adults have a 1.5-fold greater risk of developing T2D than White non-Latine adults. The Endocrine Society 2024 guidelines recommend vitamin D replacement for individuals at high-risk of prediabetes. Evidence suggests treatment of vitamin D deficiency delays the progression of prediabetes to T2D for non-Latine White adults. However, for underrepresented populations, the effects of treating vitamin D deficiency on the progression to T2D is still unclear."

The secondary aims of this study are to quantify the number of immunizations that are not present in both Statewide Immunization Online Network (SIMON) and the records it transmits to pharmacies while evaluating potential sources of discordance. Over the past decade the role of pharmacy professionals in immunization practices has changed drastically. As more immunizations become available to patients, the demand for pharmacy-based immunization services increases in tandem with more pharmacies and pharmacy staff members answering the call. In South Carolina, all immunizers are required to report immunizations to SIMON. To manage the balance of dispensing and immunization services pharmacies seek means to improve efficiency in immunization processes. One method of improvement takes the form of the bidirectional HL7 immunization integration, which automatically retrieves and reports immunization records to SIMON, relieving pharmacy staff of the need to manually retrieve and input immunization records to SIMON. While this process serves to aid pharmacies in their immunization efforts, the literature evaluating the accuracy of records retrieved and reported to SIMON is limited."

1101 Technician Roles in Vaccinations: Impact of California Immunization Registry Access on Vaccine Co-Administration Rates in Community Pharmacies,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This project evaluates the impact of California Immunization Registry (CAIR) access training for pharmacy technicians by comparing vaccine co-administration rates between pharmacies with and without CAIR access for technicians. Between 2017 and 2021, CDC statistics indicated only slight improvements in adult vaccination rates, with 1.4% increase in influenza vaccinations and 1.7% rise in herpes zoster vaccinations. However, pneumococcal vaccination rates declined by 0.8%, leaving overall coverage below the 80% ACIP target. Immunization Information Systems (IIS) are crucial for tracking vaccinations. California consolidated its IIS into the CAIR in 2017 to improve data accuracy and public health outcomes across the state. 
A systematic review found the involvement of pharmacy technicians in vaccine screening could improve patient outcomes, although results were not statistically significant. Key limitations included incomplete vaccine histories and technicians’ low confidence, attributed to the complexity of their roles. Legislative changes under Assembly Bill 1797 now require all vaccine providers in California to report data to CAIR, which is anticipated to improve vaccine history accuracy. Streamlined training programs for technicians are recommended to enhance their confidence and effectiveness in vaccine screening. Furthermore, co-administration of vaccines – administering multiple vaccines on the same day – offers significant logistical and public health advantages. Research indicates that this approach can reduce hospitalization and healthcare costs, thereby improving efficiency and health outcomes in vaccination practices."

1296 Naloxone Dispensing After a Pharmacist-Led Intervention,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Background/objective(s): 
The primary objective of this project is to evaluate why patients aged 18 years and older decline naloxone therapy after participating in a clinical intervention. The secondary objective is to assess patient satisfaction with a pharmacist-led clinical intervention for naloxone. Since the pandemic began, over 560,000 overdose-related deaths have occurred in the United States. The risk of overdose is particularly high for patients with a total daily morphine milligram equivalent (MME) ≥90. Naloxone is a life-saving medication that quickly reverses opioid overdose. Many patients are not adequately educated about naloxone or how to access it. Discussions about naloxone and overdose prevention are less common in middle- and high-income areas, where healthcare professionals may incorrectly assume patients are at lower risk for opioid overdose. Since August 2015, pharmacists in this state can prescribe naloxone under a standing order. There are several challenges in dispensing naloxone to vulnerable populations, including cost, stigma, patient discomfort in asking for naloxone, and pharmacists' concern about offending patients by offering it. Other barriers include incorporating naloxone dispensing into pharmacy workflows, patient refusals, and the time required for counseling."
1009 Evaluating the Effectiveness of Weight Management Routines in Reducing the Rate of Obesity,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Background
Obesity is a medical disorder that involves a person having abnormally high levels of body fat, which increases a person’s likelihood of developing serious medical conditions such as heart disease, hypertension, and high cholesterol, which may all lead to death.1 From the 1960’s to today, obesity rates within the United States have tripled.2 These statistics come as a result of the increased availability of processed foods, lack of nutritional knowledge, and technological innovations reducing the necessity for physical exercise.3 But, with increasing rates of obesity comes forth a community focused on reducing the rate of obesity by teaching populations how to control their food intake and form a consistent exercise routine. Some people have successfully lost weight using GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy, but without instituting lifestyle adjustments, long-term success may be more difficult to achieve. People most often struggle to maintain weight loss due to physiological changes such as hormonal shifts increasing appetite sensations, decreased resting metabolic rate, and lack of lifestyle adjustments.4 Therefore, discovering the most effective weight management routine is in high demand. Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation regarding basic health and fitness, especially with the rise of social media. Many people claiming to be professionals within the fitness community have made false claims about diets and exercises that guarantee results, which has increased the necessity of creating an effective weight management routine supported by science and evidence-based information.5 This study addresses the importance of effective weight management routines that successfully reduce the rate of obesity in populations by helping people achieve and maintain a healthy body weight.
Objective
The objective of this study is to explore the efficacy of common weight management routines such as exercise, diet, and medication adherence. We will thereby determine the optimal methods for patients to achieve their weight management goals and sustain their results in order to reduce the rate of obesity.
Methods
An anonymous 20-item survey is being administered over a 90 day period to college students at a local, private university, and patients picking up a medication used to treat diabetes or for weight management purposes at a local community pharmacy. This survey will be validated with IRB approval and will be sent out early to a small sample size as a pilot project to see if there are any issues. An approximate sample size of 110 participants will be used as determined by a sample size calculation. Research participants will include a general population of people chosen at random along with people who have a BMI over 30.0 and people who have pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes. The survey will gather both quantitative and qualitative information and will be used to obtain patient-specific information on how participants manage their weight through the collection of patient demographics, types of physical activity they participate in, foods they consume, challenges they face regarding weight management, and success or failure they may have noticed while following a particular weight management routine. The survey will consist of questions regarding how participants implement various weight-management techniques and what results the participants noticed after a selected period of time. The sampling technique will consist of approaching college students and asking if they would like to participate in a survey regarding weight-management routines. We will also ask to speak with patients at the local pharmacy who come to pick up a medication used to treat a chronic medical condition, such as diabetes, in which weight-management is critical. The survey will include questions that measure the participant’s quality of life by determining whether or not the participant can complete various activities of daily living, if they have any barriers that restrict their abilities, and if their struggle with weight management has negatively affected their emotional well-being. Participants will be asked to describe the quality of their life based on the success or failure of their weight management routine. Independent variables include family history and genetic disposition. Dependent variables include a sedentary lifestyle, smoking, lack of social/emotional support, and social determinants of health. Potential implications include participants who may share inaccurate information as a result of having emotional attachments to their weight or other health conditions. This study does not provide any incentive for participation. 
Data analysis will be performed using SPSS version 28.0. Chi-Square, t-tests and ANOVAs will determine any significant differences in weight management routines on fighting obesity."
1193 Impact and Patient Perceptions of Pharmacist-Provided Gender Affirming Hormone Therapy Counseling in Transgender College Students,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective is to collect and evaluate patient responses to a survey to determine if pharmacist-provided patient education and injection kit supplies are beneficial to patients seeking gender affirming hormone therapy. A secondary objective is to assess whether receiving additional pharmacist-led counseling builds confidence and comfortability in accessing medical services within the transgender population. The population of transgender and nonbinary individuals in the United States is growing. This growth represents an emerging need in healthcare for increased education for providers on how to help patients navigate gender affirming care, as well as potential barriers to care. Transgender patients may face a number of barriers to care, which can lead to increased anxiety and aversion to seeking medical services. This can worsen patient outcomes and lead to unsafe practices. Pharmacists are uniquely qualified as medication experts to deliver patient counseling on gender affirming hormone therapy as well as injection safety and technique and are accessible to most patients."

In the last decade, more than half of the states in the U.S. have adopted legislation allowing pharmacists to prescribe hormonal contraception to address barriers faced by pregnancy-capable people. In Indiana, a statewide standing order was enacted on September 1, 2023, authorizing pharmacists to prescribe self-administered hormonal contraception. These services have expanded access for people capable of becoming pregnant to see their pharmacist for advice, prescribing, and dispensing of birth control. Studies have shown that pharmacists, student pharmacists, and providers are supportive of this legislation and acknowledge the benefits provided by these services. Despite patient interest in this pharmacist-led service, some are unaware that pharmacists are allowed to prescribe different types of birth control. This is of particular concern in Indiana given the recent implementation. The objective of this project is to explore the most desirable strategies for educating pregnancy-capable people in Indiana about the availability of pharmacist-prescribed birth control, with the aim of enhancing the education, awareness, and accessibility of these contraceptive options."

Dealing with chronic pain is a complex situation for patients that is handled by a multimodal approach with non-opioid therapy being preferred. However, chronic pain management treatment guidelines now prefer buprenorphine as first-line when an opioid medication is needed for pain control. In the past, this medication has been used more commonly in patients who are being treated for substance use disorder. This concept may leave many patients with negative feelings about using this medication due to incorrect assumptions. Research has demonstrated that few patients realize that buprenorphine is used for chronic pain management. Along with this, patients may feel misunderstood and disregarded by providers when discussing their pain and goal for care.  Patient understanding of their treatment options is important for building confidence in the care they are receiving and improving the quality of care."

They go on further to recommend breastfeeding for up to two years of age or beyond. Breastfeeding (who.int). Pharmacists, being one of the most accessible and trusted healthcare providers, are in an ideal position to help mothers achieve their breastfeeding goals and to prevent any unnecessary disruptions in their breastfeeding journey. There are many avenues in which pharmacists can be included in this process. In the community setting, pharmacists can counsel patients on the benefits of breastfeeding and provide information on medication management. In the acute care setting, pharmacists can provide education to new mothers upon discharge of their current and new medications. These are all opportunities that pharmacists can help to ensure a mother feels confident about taking medications while breastfeeding safely. A mother should not have to choose between exclusively breastfeeding and taking a prescribed medication. The two can be achieved simultaneously with the assistance of collaborative healthcare practice. The objective of our study is to demonstrate how pharmacists can play a vital role in preventing a disruption in breastfeeding through understanding pharmacokinetics of commonly prescribed medications post-partum."
1096 Pharmacist-led Intervention on Vaccination in College Students with Asthma and Diabetes,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The first objective of this project is to implement a workflow process to identify patients with asthma or diabetes in a college health population who are eligible to receive COVID-19, influenza, and pneumococcal vaccination. Additional objectives are to measure the number of COVID-19, influenza, and pneumococcal vaccines administered following the intervention and pharmacist recommendation, assess the impact of demographic factors on vaccination, and identify common barriers to vaccination. Vaccinations are critical in preventing complications from infectious diseases, particularly in individuals with chronic conditions like asthma and diabetes. Patients with these conditions are at a higher risk of severe outcomes from respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19, influenza, and pneumonia. Vaccination rates remain suboptimal, especially among younger populations, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations. College students face unique barriers to vaccination, including vaccine hesitancy driven by misinformation, social media influence, and vaccine safety concerns. Pharmacists play a key role in improving vaccination uptake through education and personalized care. This study aims to assess the impact of a pharmacist-led intervention on increasing COVID-19, influenza, and pneumococcal vaccination rates in patients with asthma and diabetes, focusing on identifying barriers and improving preventative care outcomes."
1078 Effect of chronic disease rates and diagnoses on young adult pneumococcal vaccination status in the All of Us database,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of our study is to evaluate differences in rates of pneumococcal vaccine indications and odds of vaccine receipt before age 65 across racial/ethnic groups. Vaccine disparities in the United States contribute to major downstream health inequities. Prior to late 2024, adulthood PV was recommended for individuals under 65 years old who have chronic illness or immunocompromising indications. Our prior research using All of Us (AoU) data as well as national statistics note similar or higher PV rates for Black participants before age 65 years compared to their White counterparts. These findings present a striking contrast to racial/ethnic patterns for other vaccines. We hypothesize the higher rate of PV in Black Americans may be due to higher rates of chronic disease indications in this population. The use of a large health database represents a novel, increasingly important methodology to study vaccination rates and disparities compared to most related research which derive data from a single source."
1122 Pharmacist-led Clinical Interventions in a Long-Term Care Pharmacy Serving Patients Who Reside at Home,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this project is to implement a workflow model to identify medication therapy problems (MTPs) at two independent, long-term care (LTC) pharmacies who serve patients residing in their home. LTC pharmacies providing home-based services, known as LTC@Home, can help. LTC@Home offers medication management, including synchronization, reconciliation, packaging, patient education, and care transitions to reduce hospital readmissions. This model benefits patients with disabilities and chronic conditions. Unlike traditional pharmacies, LTC pharmacies operate as closed-door facilities serving long-term care needs 24 hours per day and 7 days per week, often with same-day delivery. Examples of MTPs may include, but are not limited to, incorrect medication use, duplicate therapy, unnecessary medication, drug interaction, and adherence. The importance of identifying MTPs is to improve patient outcomes and health. Additionally, filling all a patient’s medications in one place can decrease polypharmacy."

1061 Professional Identities of Health Science Educators: A State-of-the-Art Review,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"As studies have investigated the importance and impact of professional identity (PI), health sciences educators, including pharmacy educator, are increasing efforts to understand PI. Within pharmacy, research on PI has centered on interventions in Doctor of Pharmacy curricula designed to develop students’ PI and understand their perceptions of PI. However, research on pharmacy educators is limited. A strong educator PI has been shown to influence attitudes and performance of students. Educators are actively involved in the development of students’ PI through multiple roles, including teaching, mentoring, and developing curricula. As a result, understanding pharmacy educators’ professional identities is critical. In studies with educators in other professions and secondary teachers, educator PI has been associated with quality of teaching and confidence and commitment to teaching. The aim of this study is to describe the current state of the literature on professional identity(ies) of educators in pharmacy, medicine, and nursing through a State-of-the-Art (SotA) review."

An additional objective is to identify the roles and training methods offered to pharmacy technicians in community-based pharmacies. With the addition of various patient care services that pharmacists perform in community-based pharmacies, the role of the pharmacy technician has also begun to expand. Educational backgrounds and legal or regulatory requirements for pharmacy technicians vary from state to state. In general, pharmacy technicians will have a high school or college degree in addition to formal pharmacy technician training either through an employer or an educational institution. Along with this training, many pharmacy technicians become nationally certified pharmacy technicians (CPhT). Once certified they can expand their certification with additional trainings to become advanced pharmacy technicians (CPhT-Adv). However, it is still unclear what advanced roles pharmacy technicians are involved in and the benefits or barriers pharmacies are experiencing with utilizing them within these roles."

The current Medicare Part D Star Ratings measure beneficiaries’ adherence to only three groups of medications: (1) non-insulin diabetes medications, (2) renin-angiotensin system (RAS) antagonists, and (3) statins. Star Ratings adherence is measured by the Proportion of Days Covered (PDC), with 80% or higher indicating adherent, and lower than 80% indicating non-adherent. While many Medicare Part D beneficiaries have diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia, it may also be worth considering the expansion of the medication adherence measures in the Star Ratings program to additional chronic conditions for more comprehensive quality measurement in Medicare Part D. The objectives of this study are to examine the association between adherence to Star Ratings medications (non-insulin diabetes medications, RAS antagonists, and statins) and adherence to non-Star Ratings medications (antipsychotics, anti-seizure medications, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs [DMARDs]) in Medication Part D beneficiaries."
1098 Pharmacy-Dentistry Partnerships to Improve HPV Vaccination: A Focus Group Study,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study was to explore determinants to a dental-pharmacy partnership model to support the recommendation and provision of the HPV vaccine. The single greatest predictor of HPV vaccination is a strong recommendation from a health care professional. The ability of traditional providers to offer strong vaccine recommendations declines with increasing patient age, as most adolescents and adults do not routinely visit their primary care provider (PCP). Dentists and pharmacists are two healthcare professionals that may prove to be critical in reaching this goal. While adolescents do not routinely visit their PCP, the majority do visit their dentist at least annually. Many dentists already discuss oral cancer prevention with their patients but lack the ability to administer the HPV vaccine in office. Coupling a strong HPV vaccine recommendation from dentists, with the follow-up of an easily accessible and trusted pharmacist to administer the vaccine strengthens the immunization neighborhood and may be the collaborative intervention needed to improve HPV immunization coverage and reduce the incidence of HPV-associated cancers. However, the determinants of and implementation strategies needed to support this partnership model remain unknown."
1211 Pharmacist-Dietitian Collaboration: Evaluating Pharmacy-Based Referral for In-Person Dietitian Services in A Large Community Pharmacy Chain,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of pharmacist-dietitian referral mechanisms on patient engagement with a dietitian when pharmacy staff refer eligible patients to in-person dietitian services. Community-based pharmacists located in retail supermarket chains are uniquely positioned to use both medications and food selection in the development and implementation of a patient care plan. Food as medicine (FAM) interventions allow healthcare providers to provide care on the whole person level rather than just their disease state. FAM consists of nutrition interventions related to preventing, treating, and managing diet-related health needs and using the health-care ecosystem to incorporate nourishing food into patient care plans and is endorsed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Literature supports that dietitians can provide meaningful impacts in the care of patients living with CVD and/or diabetes. The inclusion of dietitian services for patients with these conditions has been able to show improved chronic disease management and improved laboratory values. However, collaboration between pharmacists and dietitians in community pharmacy has not been studied extensively, especially within the United States. However, international studies on pharmacist-dietitian collaboration in community pharmacy have shown to improve outcomes. Given the positive impact that pharmacists have on both adherence and clinical markers, there may be synergy in pharmacist-dietitian collaboration. Moreover, pharmacist-dietitian collaboration represents a rapidly scalable model given the accessibility of supermarket-pharmacy locations in the U.S. The purpose of this study is to evaluate in-person dietitian referrals for eligible patients by pharmacy staff at a U.S. community-based pharmacy chain."

"1371 Compassion Fatigue, Moral Distress, and Burnout Among Practicing Pharmacists in the United States",2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Objective: This study aims to explore the relationships between moral distress, secondary traumatic stress (STS), compassion fatigue, burnout, perceived support, and demographic characteristics of practicing pharmacists across the United States. Background: Compassion is essential to patient care, significantly influencing both care quality and outcomes. However, burnout and STS can negatively impact a caregiver's ability to provide compassionate care. Burnout, a response to work-related stress, has gained renewed attention since the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in healthcare. It has been linked to decreased productivity, job turnover, and poor patient outcomes. STS, resulting from exposure to traumatic events, is also a significant issue for pharmacists, who face both emotional and systemic pressures. Some scholars argue that the focus should shift from burnout to moral distress, which arises when individuals act against their moral beliefs, causing deep emotional distress. Improving pharmacists’ working conditions is essential, but perceived social support may also help mitigate these issues. Social support is the experience of being cared for, valued, and part of a supportive network. Studies suggest that pharmacists who perceive social support at work may be less likely to experience burnout, compassion fatigue, and moral distress. Pharmacists, playing a crucial role in healthcare, are increasingly susceptible to these stressors, with over half of surveyed pharmacists reporting burnout, STS, or moral distress. Despite this prevalence, there is limited research on the specific drivers of pharmacist burnout. Existing studies primarily focus on physicians and nurses, leaving gaps in understanding how these issues affect pharmacists. Additionally, little is known about how workplace behaviors and cultures might alleviate these negative experiences."

Past studies have demonstrated a lack of gender equity in pharmacy academia. Though women constitute 51.3% of the full-time faculty in the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP), AACP data show inequity in salary between men and women especially at higher academic ranks. Recent studies have also shown inequity in tenure, national awards, board memberships, etc. where men are more favored. Women in pharmacy academia have reported less satisfaction with their job and work-life balance.  In 2020, the American Pharmacists Association-Academy of Pharmaceutical Research and Science’s Economic, Social and Administrative Sciences (APhA-APRS ESAS) Section and the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy’s Social and Administrative Sciences (AACP SAS) formed the Gender Equity Task Force to determine if there is a perception of gender inequity in pharmacy academia.

1072 Addressing Vaccine Confidence and Uptake in Urban New York Community Pharmacies Among Socially Vulnerable Patients: A Mixed-Methods Approach,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Lack of vaccine confidence can lead to increased disease burden, patient inequities, and decreased trust in healthcare providers. This is more prevalent among socially vulnerable patients, including those with low socioeconomic status, disabilities, and minority groups. For instance, in urban settings like Brooklyn, NY, only 9% of the African American/Black and Hispanic/Latino populations received the COVID-19 vaccine in the early stages of the rollout, compared to nearly 20% of the non-Hispanic White population. These disparities lead to higher rates of hospitalization and death, highlighting the need for interventions. Community pharmacists, one of the most accessible healthcare providers and vaccinators, play a major role in addressing vaccination concerns and health inequities. Their proximity and ability to impact at-risk groups and their established relationships within these communities make them ideal for implementing the interventions. Therefore, this study aims to 1) evaluate perspectives regarding vaccine confidence levels among urban pharmacy personnel and 2) develop a toolkit for addressing vaccine confidence, especially among socially vulnerable urban patient populations."

Background: Cell phone usage is a major topic of discussion for many people in today's society. Some parents and teachers are concerned about the amount of time people are spending on their phones. While technology has advantages, it also has the potential to cause problems. Studies have shown that children who spend more than 2-3 hours on electronics such as cell phones, laptops, and gaming consoles experience more social and emotional-developmental issues(1). Problematic phone usage has been investigated in some studies, (defined as preoccupation with your phone or spending excessive time on your cell phone) demonstrating a negative correlation with respect to mental health.(2) There exists an increased prevalence of mental illness worldwide. Depression rates have increased 63% from 2009 to 2017 and psychological distress rates have increased 71% from 2008 to 2017 in young adults(3). In more recent studies, which focused specifically on anxiety and depression, stated the rate of anxiety to be 36% of all young adults, and the rate of depression was 29% of all young adults in 2022(4). From 2008 to 2019, rates of medications being used to treat mental health disorders has increased globally around 4%(5). Compared to older generations, younger adults have followed social trends which include the use of technology. Studies have shown the increase of mental illness is not impacted by genetic factors but rather how cultural changes impact social interaction(3). An example of this can be seen with a recent study showing young adults, ages 18 to 34 reporting stress levels twice as high as those above the age of 65(6). As mental health declines overall, it can be assumed that the rates of prescription medication used to treat these disorders would inversely increase. This study will collect and analyze data on phone usage and mental well-being/medication usage to confirm any correlation between the amount of screen time and its effects on a person taking medications for their mental well-being."

1026 Potential of hydrogen sulfide donor against excitotoxicity induced by N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA),2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been known as a toxic and flammable gas for several centuries. The research on H2S mainly focused on understanding its toxicological profile until the late 20th century when its pharmacological functions were discovered. In the late 1980’s and 1990’s, pioneering work by several research groups led to the discovery of H2S as an endogenous gasotransmitter with pharmacological and physiological roles in the mammalian cells  Subsequent studies have also reported its roles such as cytoprotection, neuroprotection, smooth muscle relaxation, vasorelaxation and regulation of blood pressure, anti-inflammation, cellular respiration, etc. Owing to its critical role in mammalian pathophysiology, H2S has found potential applications in several conditions as a therapeutic molecule.
This study will focus on the application of H2S in glaucoma, an ocular neurodegenerative disorder. Glaucoma is characterized by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and cupping of the optic nerve head, leading to visual defects and loss of vision. Glutamate release has been implicated as a mechanism of RGC death in glaucoma and inhibition or blockade of glutamate activity—in particular, modulation of NMDA receptor has been advocated to be an important strategy for neuroprotection in glaucoma. Literature reports that some exogenously administered H2S-releasing donors can attenuate excitotoxicity induced by NMDA in bovine isolated retina (Opere CA et al., JOPT, 34:10, 2018), suggesting that H2S can potentially serve a neuroprotective role in the mammalian retina. However, the effect of H2S on NMDA-induced retinal degeneration in bovine retina, ex vivo has not been investigated. Therefore, in this study, we will test the hypothesis that a H2S donor, diallyl tetrasulfide (DATTS) can mitigate NMDA-induced retinal degeneration in bovine retina, ex vivo."
1369 Can College-Age Women Identify Contraceptive Misinformation Found on TikTok?,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This research aims to investigate the ability of college-age women to identify contraceptive misinformation found on the popular social media platform TikTok. TikTok is known for its ability to rapidly spread information as increasing numbers of young women use it as a source for health-related content and advice; however, previous studies have found that videos posted to TikTok about contraception health were low quality, and contained unreliable information, mainly created by non-healthcare professionals and focusing on side effects. Viewers may lack the ability to differentiate between factual information and misinformation about contraception, leading to unintended pregnancies and increasing the possibility of sexual health-related complications.  Pharmacists and student pharmacists have important roles in providing accurate information and teaching patients media literacy to combat medical misinformation."

1200 Impact of Pharmacist-Led Remote Patient Monitoring on Diabetes Care in a Family Medicine Clinic,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of pharmacist-led remote patient monitoring (RPM) of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) on diabetes care in a family medicine clinic. The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of pharmacist-led RPM on therapeutic inertia. Clinical CGM outcomes including glucose management indicator (GMI), time in range (TIR) and glycemic variability (%CV) will be assessed and analyzed.  

According to the CDC, approximately 9% of the U.S. population (29.7 million people) have been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus.1 There are additional 1.2 million Americans diagnosed with diabetes on an annual basis.1 Technological advances such as continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices are now more readily available for patients with diabetes to ease glycemic control. Despite these advancements many patients still struggle to reach their therapeutic goals. 

Previous studies have shown the prevalence of therapeutic inertia, sometimes referred to as clinical inertia. This is defined as the failure to initiate or intensify therapy when clinical goals are not reached.2 Based on an analysis conducted by Cleveland Clinic, the average time for a therapeutic intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes was 14 months after initiation of therapy.3 In a study conducted by Pantalone et al, clinical inertia in type 2 diabetes patients was analyzed in relation to the A1C level. This study showed more than 60% of patients did not receive any interventions, escalation, or de-escalation, within the first 6 months, despite clinical outcome goals not being reached during that time.4 

There is limited research on the benefit of pharmacist-led remote patient monitoring in patients with diabetes. This study aims to evaluate the impact of pharmacist interventions on clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes being remotely monitored using continuous glucose monitoring devices."

The secondary objectives of the project are to assess the number of travel clinics in 2018 compared to 2024 and evaluate the number of these clinics that are pharmacist-run. From July of 2019 to July of 2024, there was an 16.8% increase in departures of US citizens to international regions. The CDC recommends that all travelers schedule an appointment with a travel health specialist at least one month prior to their travel. Pharmacists provide a wide variety of services in travel health, including pre-travel risk assessments, vaccinations, medication recommendations, and nonpharmacologic health advice. State to state legislations vary, which influences the level of autonomy pharmacists may have in these activities.The most recent review of state legislation regarding independent prescribing of travel health medications by pharmacists was completed in 2018 and the number of states allowing this was relatively low. With the speed that pharmacist scope is expanding, this study’s goal is to fill in gaps from 2018 and update states that have passed legislation in recent years."

1405 Utilizing Drug Repurposing to Enhance Chemotherapy Efficacy in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (HGSOC),2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"BACKGROUND: High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most common ovarian cancer subtype, but it is often diagnosed late due to its asymptomatic nature, leading to poor prognosis. While platinum-based chemotherapy, particularly carboplatin (CP), is initially effective in 60-80% of patients, most eventually develop resistance, resulting in tumor recurrence and a median survival of <12 months. Addressing CP resistance is critical for improving patient outcomes. Drug repurposing, defined as identifying new uses for existing drugs, offers a promising strategy to overcome chemoresistance. Aloxistatin, a cysteine protease inhibitor, and rigosertib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, are under investigation in Roosevelt Pharmacy Laboratories for their potential to enhance CP efficacy. The mechanisms through which aloxistation and rigosertib elicit this synergy remain uncharacterized. This study seeks to develop probe molecules of aloxistatin and rigosertib to enable the identification of both drug’s binding partner in ovarian cancer cells, and accordingly, the elucidation of druggable targets to overcome CP resistance in ovarian cancer cells. OBJECTIVE: The study has two primary objectives: • Objective 1: To synthesize and validate a protein pull-down probe derived from aloxistatin. • Objective 2: To assess whether a rigosertib-probe can resensitize ovarian cancer cells to carboplatin."
"1133 Adverse Childhood Experiences, GRIT, and the pharmacy student",2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study was to establish a baseline description of the prevalence of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and its association with Grit score in students completing a 4-year doctorate of pharmacy program in the United States. ACEs refer to various potentially traumatic events that individuals may encounter during their early years of life. A strong association has been identified between ACEs and an increased risk for chronic disease, mental health disorders, substance abuse, and early mortality in the general population. The Grit score is a measurement of a person’s ability to persevere and pursue long term goals. Studies evaluating Grit scores have found those with higher grit scores had better overall health outcomes and fewer poor mental health days. Grit has been found to predict satisfaction with life and academic resilience among pharmacy students specifically. Additionally, a higher number of ACEs and lower Grit score have individually been associated with increased risk of burnout. Understanding the prevalence of ACEs and if it impacts a person’s Grit score has implications for pharmacy student and new practitioner success, both personal and professional, their career path, and their risk of burnout."

1060 Postgraduate Training Programs for International Healthcare Professionals in the United States: A Scoping Review,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Postgraduate training programs play a critical role in shaping the skills and competencies of healthcare professionals across various fields, including medicine, pharmacy, nursing, and dentistry. These programs offer training that contributes to the delivery of high-quality healthcare. Although there is research available on international medical graduates (IMGs) and their participation in United States (U.S.) postgraduate training programs, the body of research related to international healthcare professionals (IHPs) in other healthcare disciplines remains limited. We have conducted two related studies in the pharmacy domain, but uncertainty about the scope of evidence available in other healthcare fields remains. This gap in comprehensive evidence highlights the need for a review that synthesizes the available literature across disciplines.
IHPs actively seek postgraduate training opportunities in the U.S. but often face significant barriers, such as visa-related challenges, concerns about the quality of pre-graduate training obtained abroad, and issues surrounding licensure eligibility, all of which complicate their entry into U.S. training programs. Furthermore, a lack of accessible information regarding program requirements and expectations adds to these challenges. 
The primary objective of this review is to identify the type and extent of evidence available in the current literature on postgraduate training opportunities for IHPs in the U.S. A secondary objective is to identify and analyze knowledge gaps in this area."
1158 Association Between Opioid Use and Emergency Department Visits for Spine-related Disorders,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Opioids are frequently prescribed to patients with spine-related disorders (SRD), including those undergoing spinal surgery and those with various back or neck pain, which may or may not be specific. The risk of adverse effects leading to hospitalization following opioid use among SRD patients is well-established in both clinical trials and real-world studies. However, the representativeness of patients in these studies is limited.

1165 The Impact of Medicinal Cannabis on Opioid Use in Chronic Pain,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Cannabis targets the endocannabinoid system to relieve pain and inflammation. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) from cannabis binds to various naturally occurring cannabinoids like CB1, CB2, other related CB receptors, and ion channels in the body.1 Although the endogenous CB receptors have been studied for use in antinociception in the past, the exponential research on medicinal cannabis (MC) has allowed for certified medical use of cannabis, including for the treatment of chronic pain.2,3 A 2023 open-label, prospective observational cohort study included 113 patients to evaluate the impact of reducing chronic pain with MC across 3 months via tincture, flower, and tablets. The mean rating based on a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) across seven severity items from the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI) was 6.24 (SD = 2.09) at baseline and 4.98 (SD = 2.56) at three months. Preliminary evidence suggests that MC may be an efficacious option to reduce both pain severity and interference while improving quality of life (QOL), mood, and somnolence in patients with chronic pain.4 Additionally, there is a notable probability of dependence including up to 19% of people using prescription opioids and 45% of people using heroin report their use stemming from initial dependence on an opioid prescription.5 Furthermore, CDC literature states that opioids are not recommended for long-term treatment in managing chronic pain.6  MC research may assist with pushing the current CDC Opioid Prescribing Guidelines to explore alternatives to opioid and non-opioid prescription pain medications as a means to decrease opioid dependency. This alludes to the potential for continuing federal and state research on MC as an analgesic alternative aiding to advancements in opioid prescribing. This study aims to provide a basis for medicinal cannabis use as it relates to continuing research for decreasing opioid use for chronic pain. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of medicinal cannabis use on the QOL of patients experiencing chronic pain and to determine whether medicinal cannabis acts as an alternative for opioids and other analgesic therapies."

1326 Factors Related to Medication Adherence Among People Experiencing Homelessness (PEH),2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The circumstances of homelessness, such as exposure to chronic stress, contribute to chronic conditions among people experiencing homelessness (PEH) that are managed through medications. Generally, medication adherence is challenging because of factors such as adverse effects, cost, and medication regimen complexity. These factors, coupled with homelessness-related factors (e.g., competing needs/priorities, lack of secure storage area) exacerbate medication nonadherence among PEH. While qualitative studies have described how some of these issues negatively impact medication adherence among PEH, few studies have examined the relationship between these factors and medication adherence among PEH. Therefore, this study, guided by the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations, aims to 1) describe traditional and vulnerable predisposing, enabling, and need factors and medication adherence among PEH, and 2) examine the relationships between traditional and vulnerable predisposing, enabling, and need factors and medication adherence among PEH, while controlling for respective traditional and vulnerable predisposing, enabling, and need factors."

1075 Assessing the Impact of Hepatitis B Vaccination versus Non-Vaccination Among People with Diabetes,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) states that people with diabetes are at increased risk for hepatitis B infection and transmission due to the shared use of medical equipment such as glucose meters, lancets, syringes, and pen needles. The ACIP recommends that all individuals aged 19–59 years with diabetes receive the HepB vaccination series, and adults aged 60 years or older should receive the vaccine based on clinical judgment, particularly those with additional risk factors such as intravenous drug use, incarceration, unprotected sexual history, hepatitis C, HIV, dialysis, and cirrhosis. 
In 2021, the CDC estimated that 38.1 million adults in the U.S. had diabetes, with 73.8% of them having never received the HepB vaccination series. Among adults with diabetes aged 18–59, 64.1% had never been vaccinated, while 80.3% of adults aged over 60 had never been vaccinated. These statistics highlight a significant gap in HepB vaccination rates among individuals with diabetes.
The primary objectives of this study are to assess HepB vaccination status among individuals with diabetes and increase vaccination rates. Secondary objectives include evaluating participants' knowledge, eligibility, and perceptions regarding the need for the HepB vaccine to provide education and raise awareness."

Background:
Hypertension (HTN) affects over 20% of the Kenyan population, yet more than 70% of those diagnosed are not treated. Studies have also shown that untreated oral diseases and conditions can contribute to elevated BP, cardiovascular complications, and affect the patient’s well-being and quality of life. However, an increased risk of bleeding and cardiac events associated with HTN precludes patients from receiving dental care. This retrospective cohort study evaluates the initial and adjusted protocols developed by the 2024 Kansas to Kenya (K2K) Medical Mission Pharmacy Team to lower BP for dental patients."
Evaluation of Mixing Technologies for Small-Scale Preparation of Direct-Compressed Doxycycline Tablets,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Objective:
The aim in this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of three mixing technologies: Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM) technology, V-Blender, and Cube-Blender, in the production of direct-compressed doxycycline tablets with Prosolv® Easytab as the co-excipient of choice. 

Purpose:
Doxycycline (DOX) is tetracycline-member, broad-spectrum antibiotic widely used for the treatment of several infections including rickettsial infections, respiratory infections, and leptospirosis. More recently, The CDC has recommended the use of Doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis for some sexually transmitted infections. Doxycycline characteristics such as stickiness and sensitivity to light make it an ideal candidate for studying the effect of blend uniformity on the final dosage form.   
The study focused on preparing direct-compressed doxycycline tablets using three different mixing technologies for the blending process. The blending efficiency was compared to determine which mixing technology led to obtain tablets with better chemical and physical properties. Doxycycline formulations were prepared as a binary combination of the drug and Prosolv® Easytab. Easytab is a silicified microcrystalline cellulose co-excipient designed for direct compression tablets. The co-excipients are designed to be ready to use, making them suitable for direct compression especially in drugs that are easy to blend and results in homogeneous blend.  The co-excipients simplify the blending process as compared to traditional methods such as wet and dry granulation. These methods are time consuming and require multiple processing steps for both the drug and the excipients. This project evaluated the preparation of formulas on a small scale that may be used for clinical manufacture and for the small production of custom sized batches."
1332 Increasing the Use of Manufacturer Copay Card Usage at a Community Pharmacy: A Pilot Study,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"In 2021, 6.5% of adults with private health insurance and 11.4% with other coverage reported not taking their medication as prescribed due to cost. When patients do not pick up their prescribed medication from the pharmacy, this is prescription abandonment. A small number of studies have suggested manufacturer copay cards can help improve prescription abandonment. One of the ways pharmacists can help patients afford their medication is with Manufacturer Copay Cards. These programs are offered by manufacturers and can help patients who have insurance by covering a portion of the patient's copay, lowering the cost after insurance is applied. Some manufacturer copay cards can be run without insurance, allowing them to be used for the uninsured. A 2018 study of pharmacists in Connecticut reported pharmacist’s view these cards favorably, with more than 90% feeling these programs lower out of pocket costs and increase access to medications. The majority of community pharmacists (84%) believe all community pharmacists should be applying these coupons whenever possible. 

Based on this information, an independent community pharmacy wanted to research and evaluate a pilot program to increase the usage of manufacturer copay cards.

The primary objective is to measure how many patients are enrolled in manufacturer copay cards (MCC). The secondary objectives are to measure how much time pharmacy staff spend helping patients enroll in MCC programs, how much money patients save, and improve medication adherence of prescribed brand medications. In 2022, 23% of Americans were underinsured and copay cards are a means to lower costs and improve medication affordability for insured and underinsured patients."

1344 Development and Validation of a Machine Learning Prediction Model for COPD Readmissions: Enhancing Early Risk Stratification and Intervention,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This study aimed to use machine-learning (ML) methods to generate a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 30-day hospital readmission prediction model to profile patients at greatest risk. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of hospital readmissions, representing a significant burden on healthcare systems and patients alike. Studies have shown that approximately 20-25% of patients hospitalized for acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Despite efforts to improve COPD management and reduce readmissions, rates remain high. Pharmacist-led transitions-of-care programs are effective in improving reducing  readmission rates. However, these programs are costly and most cost-effective when delivered to patients at greatest risk of readmission. Previous prediction models are based on  limited healthcare system data or used traditional statistical methods – methods that limit our ability to understand complex interplay of factors contributing to COPD readmissions. In contrast, ML methods are better suited at identifying complex interactions among risk factors that may identify subgroups with particularly high risk."

HEDIS measures are a set of measures established by the National Committee for Quality Assurance and function as a performance improvement tool for health plans.  Within these measures, some pertain to medication management and when a patient’s medications are not optimized, this is a care gap. Some health plans partner with pharmacists through payer contracts to close these gaps and ensure patients have access to medications to manage their disease states. Community Pharmacy Enhanced Services Networks (CPESN) is a nationwide, clinically integrated network of pharmacies which facilitates contracts such as these between their network and payers to offer reimbursements for clinical services provided, such as medication adherence and reviews. Elevance Health provided participating pharmacies with a patient list which listed those with HEDIS gaps. Pharmacists then provided interventions to close the gap and submitted eCare plans for reimbursement, improving patient care and financial sustainability.   
In offering these services pharmacists have been shown to improve medication utilization, mental health medication adherence, and respiratory therapy medication measures.  A retrospective observational study of eCare plans submitted by 526 CPESN pharmacies classified seven categories of services illustrating what interventions pharmacists were completing but did not relate the interventions to specific patient outcomes. Based on current literature, pharmacist interventions are being conducted and can improve patient care, however, there is a gap in literature in understanding the most impactful interventions to close gaps in care related to HEDIS measures. This information will be beneficial for pharmacists and patients. By understanding how"
1327 Finding Harmony in Addressing Social Determinants of Health in the Pharmacy Setting,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Social determinants of health (SDoH) account for 50-60% of health outcomes.  Pharmacists are uniquely positioned to screen for adverse SDoH, or social risks, and address social needs, the conditions an individual seeks assistance with immediately. However, previous research has demonstrated that pharmacists lack confidence and experience performing this screening. This session will review the results of survey of Alabama pharmacist current screening and referral activities, awareness of resources, willingness to implement SDoH services, and attitudes regarding SDoH services and the impact of a continuing education (CE) webinar on these areas."
1209 Patient Satisfaction and Self-Reported Understanding with Pharmacist-Led Interventions for Travel Medicine,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"International travel is a prevalent activity for millions of Americans, with over 98.5 million citizens traveling abroad in 2023. The World Health Organization emphasizes the importance of seeking healthcare advice one to two months prior to travel to ensure optimal immunization responses and the timely initiation of necessary medications. Community pharmacists, trained in travel health, can significantly enhance patient care by providing timely vaccinations, medications, and health supplies tailored to individual travel needs. 

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate patients’ understanding of travel-related health information after exposure to a pharmacist-led travel consultation.  

The secondary objective of this study is to measure patient’s’ satisfaction with a pharmacist-led travel consultation."
1070 A qualitative analysis of rural community vaccination barriers during the COVID-19 pandemic,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Despite wide availability of vaccines and immunization services, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases continue to occur. Rural United States residents experience increased disparity of care for both general healthcare services and access to routine vaccines.  Previous rural research has indicated a 40% lower mean vaccination rate in rural communities, as compared to urban counterparts.  Having a better understanding regarding lower vaccination rates in rural areas could help government and public health officials address vaccine hesitancy and be prepared to address future pandemics.  This research sought to evaluate the opinions of people who live and work in rural areas regarding barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake."

There are approximately 40,000 patients, including children and adults, in the United States, and 1,000 new cases occur every year. CF patients are left vulnerable to multiple challenges due to chronic pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. Although there are multiple antimicrobial agents available for treatment, the alerting rise of antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa necessitated evaluating the cost-effectiveness of treatment options.

Objectives: This systematic literature review aims to identify treatment patterns of lung infections caused by P. aeruginosa in CF patients and evaluate the economic impacts of different antimicrobial treatment options."
1365 Assessing College Students� Awareness and Misconceptions about Vaping: Implications for Community Pharmacy Smoking Cessation Programs,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This project aims to assess the awareness and misconceptions related to vaping among undergraduate and graduate students at an independent pharmacy, with the goal of improving community pharmacy-led smoking cessation programs. Vaping, particularly the use of e-cigarettes, has become increasingly prevalent among young adults aged 18-24, with higher rates of use in this age group compared to other adults. Despite the health risks, including nicotine addiction, impaired brain development, and exposure to harmful chemicals found in vape aerosols, many young adults remain unaware of the full scope of dangers associated with vaping. Furthermore, community pharmacies have long been established as key players in delivering smoking cessation services, but there is a lack of specific guidelines targeting vaping cessation. This study seeks to address these gaps by evaluating students’ understanding of vaping-related health risks, identifying common misconceptions, and assessing their awareness of community pharmacy smoking cessation resources."
1288 Impact of Direct Scheduling by Pharmacists on Patient Acceptance of Pharmacist-provided Referral for Dietitian Services,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The study objective is to measure the effectiveness of direct patient scheduling by community pharmacists to engage patients in attending dietitian appointments after pharmacist referral. Registered dietitians provide services such as nutritional assessment, meal planning, medical nutrition therapy, lifestyle coaching, and weight management programming. Dietitian referrals are beneficial for patients who are starting a new medication for a nutrition-related condition (i.e. weight management, diabetes, heart disease, gastrointestinal disease), have been denied medications for a nutrition-related condition, have questions about food choices for managing a medical condition, have questions about drug-nutrient interactions, have been diagnosed with a food allergy, sensitivity, or intolerance, are looking for meal or snack ideas that fit their cultural and lifestyle needs, health goals, and budget, and for patients who may be food or nutrition insecure. The accessibility of community pharmacists places them in a prime position to advocate for and facilitate whole-person healthcare. With referrals from pharmacists to registered dietitians, a pathway is created for patients to bridge the connection between food and medicine to holistically manage their health. At a large community pharmacy chain, standard practice is for pharmacists to recommend a dietitian consult to patients who may benefit from these services, with the patient responsible for later scheduling an appointment. As a new quality improvement initiative, pharmacists can directly schedule the initial dietitian appointment for a patient at the time of initial recommendation and following patient assent, with the goal of streamlining the process for the patient and increasing the likelihood of appointment attendance. This study will assess patient perceptions of these pharmacist-facilitated dietitian appointments through a voluntary survey."
1004 Bridging the Gap: Addressing Racial Disparities in Treatment Outcomes for Second-Degree Heart Block,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Background: Coronary heart disease affects 18.2 million Americans, with only 3% (540,000) diagnosed with second-degree heart block, a rare condition characterized by intermittent failure of electrical signals between the atria and ventricles. Although a majority of patients are White (60%), Black patients with heart block make up a substantial proportion (30%). Racial disparities in diagnostic and treatment patterns for second-degree heart block remain poorly understood. This study aimed to examine racial differences in treatment patterns, specifically in pacemaker implantation and syncope related hospitalizations among patients with second-degree heart block."
1088 Impact of community health worker and pharmacy technician vaccine hesitancy education on influenza vaccination,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Objective: The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a pharmacy-based community health worker pharmacy technician vaccine hesitancy intervention in closing pneumococcal immunization gaps.

Background: The influenza virus that accompanies the annual flu season causes approximately 9.3 – 41 million illnesses, 100,000 – 710,000 hospitalizations, and 4,900 – 51,000 deaths among U.S. adults per year despite the availability of effective vaccines. Vaccinations are one of the most cost-effective medical treatments known, yet healthcare providers struggle to bring this message to patients and struggle to provide those vaccinations, particularly in vulnerable populations. Previous health care provider surveys identified gaps in provider knowledge about and understanding of the adult influenza vaccine recommendations, and influenza vaccine coverage remains suboptimal. Community health workers integrated into community pharmacies help bridge this gap through education on vaccine hesitancy and have been shown to improve vaccination rates in pilot programs. Community Pharmacy Enhanced Services Network (CPESN) Missouri implemented a Pharmacy Vaccine Gap Closure Program providing vaccine hesitancy education through cross trained community health worker pharmacy technicians January 2024 – July 2024. Patients completed a questionnaire that gathered demographic information, health-related social needs, existing health conditions, and current vaccination eligibility during the educational intervention."
1034 Analysis of the Differences between Glucose Management Indicator (GMI) and A1c Tests to Determine Continuous Glucose Monitor Accuracy,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,Hemoglobin A1c readings are utilized to give both healthcare providers and patients a clearer picture of how well their diabetes is being managed over time. Blood glucose trends can be gathered either by continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) or traditional finger stick blood glucose monitors (BGM). CGMs provide real-time monitoring of blood glucose levels over a two-week period and offer a more user-friendly solution for patients compared to traditional methods. The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of CGMs in predicting A1c levels by comparing the two-week Glucose Management Indicator (GMI) to the A1C readings thereby assessing their continued potential as reliable tools for long-term glycemic management.
1268 Evaluating Patient Satisfaction and Perceived Economic Impact of Long-Acting Injectable Administration by Pharmacists in a Community Pharmacy Setting,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to evaluate patient satisfaction with pharmacist-administered long-acting injectables (LAIs), specifically Abilify Maintena, Invega Sustenna, and Risperdal Consta, in community pharmacies, compared to alternative locations such as physician offices or mental health clinics. The secondary objective is to assess the economic impact of pharmacist-administered LAIs in community pharmacies by examining factors such as patient costs, convenience, perceived savings, insurance coverage, and out-of-pocket expenses. Antipsychotic LAIs have been shown to improve adherence to medications essential for managing conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, where consistent medication use is critical for optimal outcomes. However, barriers such as cost, administration sites, and the need for initial success with oral forms of these medications continue to pose challenges. While most prior studies have focused on inpatient or specialized clinic settings, there is a gap in understanding the benefits of providing this service in community pharmacies. Additionally, limited data quantify the economic impacts of these services when compared to other settings. This study will explore these barriers through surveys, providing insights into the benefits of pharmacist-administered LAIs in community pharmacy settings while also demonstrating their potential to improve patient satisfaction and economic outcomes."
1249 Assessment of Patients� Perception and Impression of Long-Acting Injectable Buprenorphine Administration in the Community Pharmacy Setting,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to offer insight on patients’ perspectives regarding pharmacist administration of LAIB (Long-Acting Injectable Buprenorphine) in the community setting. From 2012 to 2022, opioid related deaths in Arizona have doubled from nearly 500 to over 1,914. The stigma associated with OUD treatment persists, particularly in communities with poor health literacy and significant barriers to healthcare access. The state has implemented additional resources for patients fighting opioid addiction, including increasing access to support groups, expansion of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), and a statewide campaign to increase treatment-seeking behavior to reduce the overall stigma of opioid use. To address some of these issues at the federal level, Congress passed and President Biden signed into law the Consolidated Appropriates Act of 2023 (CAA) (21 USC 823(g)(2) that expanded patient access to medications for OUD.  The law eliminated the patient panel restrictions on prescribers and allowed community pharmacists with appropriate state authority to dispense and administer LAIBs. This program was approved to assist with patient compliance and improve patient convenience. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all MOUDs to have an approved Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program; the LAIB REMS includes the following: (1) How to obtain the LAIB, (2) Healthcare Provider REMS Letter, (3) Healthcare Setting and Pharmacy Enrollment Form, (4) REMS Document, (5) REMS Website. Other formulations of Buprenorphine (Buccal film and Transdermal patch) that have been FDA approved for the use in pain management also have the approval for use in OUD. The stigma associated with OUD treatment remains pertinent in communities where patients have poor health literacy and higher barriers to seeking healthcare."
1253 Bridging the Gap: Pharmacist Willingness for Prescribing Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis in Puerto Rico.,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to assess the willingness of pharmacists in Puerto Rico to prescribe pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV. The secondary objective is to identify attitudes, comfort, concerns, and potential barriers regarding prescribing PrEP. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative seeks to significantly reduce new HIV infections by 2030. To meet this goal in Puerto Rico, new diagnoses must be reduced to a maximum of 1.6 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year by 2030. Conversely, the most current available data reveals that the incidence rates is 13 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2022. A key strategy to attain this objective involves preventing new infections. PrEP offers individuals at risk a medication-based option for preventing HIV infection. However, access remains a significant challenge in Puerto Rico since HIV prevention services are mostly concentrated in the Metropolitan area. This results in limited access and health disparities amongst marginalized minority populations living in rural areas. Considering the extensive network of approximately 873 pharmacies across Puerto Rico, pharmacists are exceptionally well-positioned to serve as frontline healthcare providers. Nevertheless, pharmacists in Puerto Rico are not authorized to prescribe PrEP. Leveraging pharmacists’ accessibility to the public, they can play a crucial role in bridging gaps in HIV prevention services, particularly by facilitating access to PrEP. Such a collaborative effort could significantly advance the collective mission of ending the HIV epidemic. However, to effectively move forward with such initiative, it is imperative to assess factors that impact pharmacists’ willingness to prescribe PrEP in Puerto Rico."
1201 Implementing Influenza and Group A Strep Point-of-Care Testing in a Hospital-Affiliated Community Pharmacy,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Objective: Assess the success of utilizing point-of-care testing (POCT) and treatment through Iowa statewide protocol in a hospital-affiliated community pharmacy. 
Background: The CDC estimates 9 to 41 million annual cases of influenza and 20,000 to 30,000 cases of group A strep.1,2 Without timely care, these illnesses can lead to complications and even death. Since most Americans live within five miles of a community pharmacy, these locations are ideal for screening and treating acute infections such as influenza and strep.3 Implementing this service into pharmacies could enhance access to care, shorten the time between symptom onset and treatment, reduce illness transmission and duration, improve antimicrobial stewardship, and further solidify community pharmacists’ roles as healthcare providers.3,4 Hospital-affiliated community pharmacies may be able to reach a larger patient population through referrals from their hospital's urgent care centers and emergency departments for evaluation and treatment of patients with uncomplicated respiratory symptoms."
1008 Efficacy and Safety of Secondary Prophylaxis (SP) for Recurrent C. difficile Infection (rCDI) in Patients Taking Concomitant Antibiotics,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Treatment of initial C. difficile infection (CDI) is associated with a 7-10x increased chance of recurrence. RCDI is defined as CDI within 2-8 weeks of initial episode. Patients receiving subsequent systemic antibiotics are at high risk of rCDI. In these patients, American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines recommend CDI SP with oral vancomycin (OVP) concurrently with antibiotics, with low-quality evidence. Controversy exists over optimal dosing and duration of SP, and benefits versus potential risks, including VRE colonization and/or microbiome changes. This review investigated current efficacy and safety data of vancomycin or other antimicrobials as SP for rCDI in patients on systemic antibiotics."
1377 Effects of Low-Dose Naltrexone on Inflammatory Markers and Concomitant Steroid and Analgesic Use in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This retrospective observational study aims to evaluate the effects of low-dose naltrexone (LDN) therapy on inflammatory markers—C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)—as well as side effects and concomitant corticosteroid and analgesic medication use in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Additionally, it seeks to assess the potential of adding LDN as an adjunctive therapy to traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to reduce side effects and improve patient outcomes. Medical records from private rheumatology clinics will be reviewed for adult RA patients who have been taking LDN (1 mg to 4.5 mg orally daily) for at least six months since 2020. Inclusion criteria include patients aged 21 years or older with a confirmed RA diagnosis according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria. Exclusion criteria are current use of opioid analgesics, pregnancy or breastfeeding, significant hepatic or renal impairment, and patient records lacking pre- and post-LDN inflammatory markers. The study focuses on evaluating the effects of LDN on inflammatory markers, disease activity, corticosteroid and analgesic medication usage, and its adverse effects in RA patients. By analyzing existing patient records, the research aims to determine whether LDN therapy is associated with improvements in clinical outcomes and a reduction in the need for conventional RA medications like corticosteroids and DMARDs. The anticipated outcome is that LDN therapy will lead to reductions in inflammatory markers, decreased reliance on corticosteroids and analgesics, and fewer side effects in RA patients. Positive findings may support the integration of LDN as an adjunctive therapy in RA management, enhancing patient outcomes and reducing medication-related adverse effects. Future plans include conducting a prospective randomized study to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of LDN in RA patients."
1362 An evaluation of consumer willingness to accept healthcare recommendations from artificial-intelligence and community pharmacists.,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This study aims to evaluate the willingness of community-based pharmacy consumers to accept AI-based healthcare recommendations compared to pharmacist-based healthcare recommendations. Secondary objectives of this study include evaluation of the level of trust associated with AI-based and pharmacist-based healthcare recommendations; evaluation of barriers to trust or acceptance of AI-based and pharmacist-based recommendations; and an exploration of perceptions of AI-based and pharmacist-based healthcare recommendations.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the capacity of machines to carry out or perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence such as sensing, learning, and decision-making. Benefits of AI include automation of repetitive tasks, faster insights from data, and fewer human errors. In the pharmaceutical setting, AI is used to detect adverse drug reactions, assist clinical decision support systems including medical error prevention, robotic dispensing systems, and predictions of future drug purchase. These benefits can be applied to allow for higher value, individualized, and reliable patient care. The potential benefits of AI are limited by the willingness to adopt and implement such technologies.

Studies have been conducted on perceptions for the adoption and implementation of AI in private practice and other health-care settings, but little is reported on the perceptions and trust of AI in community pharmacy consumers. Community pharmacies are often the first point of contact for patients seeking healthcare recommendations due to ease of access and affordability."
1195 Impact of a Drug Donation Program on Glycemic Control (A1C) in Underserved Diabetes Patients,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study is to compare the A1C value before and after utilizing the drug donation program to dispense diabetes medications. The drug donation program functions by donating unused or unneeded medications to re-dispense to indigent populations in need of financial assistance. The donation program provides medical care for individuals who are uninsured, those without prescription coverage, and patients who are in the process of establishing an assistance program. The drug donation program will ease short-term health care costs for patients applying for prescription assistance through the drug manufacturer, which will give patients long-term financial assistance for their medications. Currently, there is limited data to support how effective the drug donation program is in adherence to patient’s treatment regimen and reducing health complications in underserved population. Many of the medications dispensed through the drug donation program are used to treat diabetes. Diabetes is one of the most common chronic conditions and can cause multiple health complications if not adherent to the appropriate medication regimen. By eliminating the financial barrier of receiving medications, we can also lower the risk of diabetes complications and hospitalization. Testing for a patient’s A1C allows providers to gauge the average glucose level over three months, which can determine if a patient’s diabetes is being managed appropriately."
1244 Assessing readiness of community pharmacists to perform billable clinical services,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to assess the readiness of community pharmacists to perform billable clinical services in accordance with the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services Medical Assistance Program. The secondary objective is to assess pharmacists' willingness to bill for services and to identify strategies for overcoming barriers. 

Pharmacists are increasingly recognized as essential healthcare providers due to their expanded roles during the COVID-19 pandemic, which bridged gaps in patient care by enhancing access to testing, treatment, and vaccination services. This has led to an increased legislative push, prompting all but nine states to reimburse for pharmacists' services, despite the lack of federally recognized provider status.  In March 2024, Pennsylvania Medicaid allowed pharmacists to enroll as mid-level providers. In the community pharmacy setting, little is known about pharmacists' preparedness to deliver and willingness to bill the services eligible for reimbursement. Current literature suggests barriers in sustainable reimbursement, clear guidelines, and open communication. As a result, many community pharmacies may struggle to incorporate billing practices without sufficient training into their existing practice model."
1076 Community Pharmacy Outreach Program to Promote RSV Vaccination in Eligible Older Adults and Improve Vaccination Rates,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study is to assess the impact on RSV vaccination rates of implementing a community pharmacy-based outreach program to educate and promote RSV vaccination in eligible older adults.
Along with influenza and COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most common causes of acute respiratory tract infection in adults. RSV infection occurs mostly during the winter months (the Respiratory Season). While many infections are mild, certain populations (elderly, immunocompromised) are at risk for disease progression into the lower respiratory tract, which could lead to both respiratory distress and failure. Though it’s estimated that RSV infection may account for up to 10,000 deaths annually in patients over 65, recent studies suggest that many of the elderly population are not aware of RSV or its potential complications in higher risk groups. The first two RSV vaccines were approved in 2023 and were shown to be 82-86% effective at preventing lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) due to RSV infection. A third RSV vaccine was approved in June 2024 and has an efficacy between 78-81% at preventing LRTD. In the 2023-2024 respiratory season, it was reported that only 17% of eligible adults had received the RSV vaccination by December 9, 2023. In this same report, it was noted that 53% of eligible adults studied were either likely going to or were unsure about getting vaccinated against RSV. Although 17% leaves a majority of eligible patients unprotected against RSV, this data also suggest that many patients are open to the possibility of getting vaccinated."
1361 A Qualitative Analysis of Healthcare Provider Insights on Medications for Opioid Use Disorder,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study is to qualitatively analyze pharmacy practice-related healthcare provider “Insights” to better understand pharmacy practice-related attitudes, behaviors, and stigma toward medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Pharmacists play an important role in MOUD access, but pharmacist-related barriers for MOUD access include lack of trust, stigma, and fear of regulatory oversight. Logistical challenges like distributor stocking limits at community pharmacies have further compounded geographical and economic disparities in pharmacy MOUD dispensing practices. Data from prescribers, pharmacists, patients, and other healthcare professionals have characterized pharmacy practice-related barriers to MOUD in the United Stated (US). This study is the first systematic evaluation of Insights documented by field-based Medical Affairs team members for a pharmaceutical company who engage with healthcare providers in their course of work. These Insights are gathered from scientific exchange, discussions with healthcare providers during unsolicited requests for medical information and collected at medical conferences."

Pilot a pharmacist-led intervention with over-the-counter continuous glucose monitors (CGM) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) not on insulin therapy. 2. Assess participant satisfaction and willingness of pharmacist-led service with a post-data collection survey. Background: This is a pilot project of a pharmacist-led service in a rural community with a satisfaction survey upon completion. The rationale behind this pilot service is that some patients with T2DM may have a challenging time reaching their glycemic targets with self-monitoring. Community pharmacists can be pivotal in consulting patients on CGM devices and interpreting results. By implementing a diabetes management service alongside the support of a CGM device, pharmacists can counsel on diet and nutrition in this rural population. Recommendations for the use of CGMs in patients with T2DM who are on insulin are clear, but less is established with patients who are not on insulin. With the recent availability of over-the-counter (OTC) CGMs, this valuable tool, along with education and monitoring, may benefit those with T2DM who are not on insulin in successfully managing their disease and delaying or preventing disease progression."

1104 A College of Pharmacy Tele-Based Approach to Addressing Health Equity,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this report is to define a stepwise approach to developing a sustainable academic telehealth center that advances pharmacy practice while addressing health equity in rural areas. There appears to be a recent emergence of telehealth services due to the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic. Using technology to assist with patient care dates back to the late 1800s and has since progressed in functionality and capability. Health care providers and organizations have long been aware of the benefits and importance of telehealth delivery models, even though the use of these services has been historically low. Recently, telehealth has met the need for socially distant care, while also opening avenues for expanded care offerings and opportunities for reimbursement. This expansion is keenly important to pharmacy practice. Many colleges of pharmacy have long been providing (and training students on) pharmacist-led health care services, such as Medication Therapy Management (MTM), but the scope and reach has been limited.  

The Xavier University Telehealth Center (XUTC) was developed to provide MTM services to rural Louisiana clinics without readily available access to a clinical pharmacist. Rural residents are often at a healthcare disadvantage due to their location, poverty rates, and lack of available health-related information. The initial focus of the telehealth center was to provide MTM to patients referred either by providers or insurance companies, to fill in the healthcare gaps that may be present. As the need for telehealth services has recently increased, the XUTC expanded its focus to also include chronic care management and remote patient monitoring."
1315 The effect of a Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support Program (DSMES) on A1c and Diabetes Distress Scales in a FQHC,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support Program (DSMES) at a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) by assessing the clinical outcome of change in 3 month Hemoglobin A1c for patients with Type II Diabetes enrolled in the program. Additionally, it will evaluate the impact of  the DSMES Program on patient-specific feelings and stressors related to diabetes by analyzing the change in Diabetes Distress Scores over 3 months by utilizing the Type 2 Diabetes Distress Assessment System (T2-DDAS). 
        With a high prevalence of diabetes diagnoses and significant gaps in knowledge and education regarding the diagnosis, DSMES curriculum has continued to be utilized around the world to enhance self-care behaviors for patients with a diagnosis of diabetes to allow them to better understand and manage their condition. The DSMES curriculum is designed to focus on seven core self-care behaviors for patients including: healthy eating; being active; taking medicine as prescribed; monitoring blood sugar levels, activity, and eating habits; reducing risks to lower the chance of diabetes related complications; healthy coping with diabetes diagnosis and emotional well-being; and problem solving to find solutions and take action. These services are offered through a variety of practice sites by different members of a healthcare team, including physicians, pharmacists, dieticians, nurses, and diabetes educators. Pharmacists continue to be widely accessible resources for patients to continue to augment chronic disease state management, including diabetes. This study aims to assess the effects of a newly implemented DSMES Program within an FQHC in a rural setting taught by pharmacists and a dietician."

1220 Uncovering Care Gaps: Parent Perspectives on Gaps in Type 1 Diabetes Management for Children Aged 8-12 Years in Kentucky and Southern Indiana,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic autoimmune condition resulting from the destruction of pancreatic beta cells, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. T1DM affects approximately 1.6 million people in the United States, including 200,000 children and adolescents. Proper management is crucial to prevent complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease, which become more likely when blood glucose is not carefully monitored from an early age. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) emphasizes individualized and comprehensive care tailored to the developmental needs of the child to prevent long-term health complications. 
While many studies focus on the biological and psychosocial aspects of T1DM management, fewer have examined how various environmental factors influence care. This research addresses that gap by applying Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory, which examines multiple layers of environmental influences—from immediate family interactions to broader societal factors—on diabetes management. Specifically, the objective of this study is to explore parent perceptions of these influences and identify gaps in care for children aged 8-12 years in Kentucky and Southern Indiana. The goal is to provide region-specific insights and inform tailored interventions."
1168 ACHIEVE-Cessation: A Pharmacist-Led Smoking Cessation Program Utilizing Mobile Health Units (MHU) In An Urban Underserved Population,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of the ACHIEVE-Cessation care pathway through a pharmacist-led smoking cessation program delivered via mobile health units (MHU) in Detroit, Michigan. Detroit ranks as the highest prevalence of cigarette smokers in the US at 30% of the population (~150,000 adults). Electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) use has been continuously increasing and in 2016 the US FDA declared ENDS as tobacco products. Almost 10% of the population in Detroit is without health insurance and has limited access to healthcare. MHUs were developed to reach some of these underserved communities and provide free health services by going to churches, schools, and community organizations. Services provided via MHUs include health screenings, vaccinations, blood pressure measurement, point of care testing (hepatitis C, HIV, Covid-19), referrals to care, and education. The MHU also provides a pharmacist-led smoking cessation program for tobacco and/or ENDS users. This program was created to increase access and reduce barriers to care for adults that smoke cigarettes or (ENDS) products. The pathway was designed to reach vulnerable communities across Detroit and link adults to a comprehensive and guideline-based smoking cessation program delivered by the pharmacy team."
1388 Expert Consensus of an Emergency Response Medication-Related Preparedness Tool for Pharmacists,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this research is to use expert pharmacist feedback to revise an emergency response readiness tool focused on medication-related preparedness designed for use by individual pharmacists in local emergency response. Events such as the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the need for planning tools to assist pharmacists with their role in emergency response efforts. Pharmacists are willing to collaborate with health care providers, community partners, and other public health professionals to execute emergency response strategies but may feel unprepared for emergency response at the local level. Currently, there are limited tools for pharmacists that focus on pharmacy team roles in medication-related preparedness for local humanitarian response efforts. One tool that currently exists is a checklist published in the American Pharmacists Association’s Disasters and Emergencies A Planning and Response Guide for Pharmacy Professionals. This checklist tool was adapted from the 2016 International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) Responding to Disasters Guidelines for Pharmacy and has not received expert consensus to date."
1052 Exploring Social Determinants of Health: Qualitative Analysis of PharmD Student Learning within a Community Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study is to analyze third-year PharmD students' Health Disparities worksheet assignments to understand how they identify and articulate the influence of social determinants of health on care for specific populations in community pharmacy settings. Healthy People 2030 defines health disparities as modifiable health differences related to social, economic, or environmental disadvantages that prevent groups from attaining their best health. According to the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) 2025 Standards, PharmD graduates should be able to mitigate disparities to improve health outcomes; however, there is no standard for how this education is incorporated into PharmD curriculum. While there are examples in the literature of schools of pharmacy incorporating health disparity education in select courses or experiences, there is a paucity of information about whether these interventions lead to student ability to effectively apply the knowledge. At our institution, health disparity education activities are embedded into all introductory practice pharmacy experiences (IPPEs) from the first to third year (P3). In the P3 community IPPE, students complete a health disparities assignment aimed at enhancing their understanding of social determinants of health (SDoH) and health disparities among marginalized populations."

Abstract Type-Reports on Projects in Progress: Contributed Research Papers
Category of Author- Student Pharmacist
Personal health literacy is how individuals find, understand, and use information and services to inform health-related decisions and actions for themselves and others.1 Health literacy is often lacking in marginalized populations and other demographic groups. In today’s society, people are still struggling with medical terms, and how their bodies work, and thus are scared and confused about their medical diagnoses.2 This results in marginalized populations having more chronic illnesses and more trips to the emergency room than those with good health literacy.3  This study seeks to explore and assess those demographics. Identifying populations that hold gaps in their health literacy is the first step in filling these gaps and correcting this issue in to promote the betterment of people's health, as health literacy is a critical determinant of overall health outcomes.2,3 

Although health literacy has been extensively studied, there is limited research that directly compares health literacy disparities across diverse populations, such as free clinic patients, insured individuals, and university faculty, while also factoring in variables like language, insurance status, income, and gender. This study fills this gap by generating actionable, localized data to inform interventions in culturally and socioeconomically diverse communities. Additionally, it provides direct insight into care gaps in patients at the local level, allowing for the implementation of more specific and targeted interventions.

This study aims to evaluate health literacy disparities among a variety of patients, including those who attend a free clinic, those who have insurance, and those who work in a university setting, all while focusing on differences based on language (English vs. Spanish speakers), insurance status (insured vs. uninsured), income categories, weight, and gender. By identifying these disparities, this study seeks to identify areas of health literacy weakness, which is the first step in the long-term goal of improving patient outcomes, especially in diverse populations."

1190 Exploring Adherence to injectable GLP-1 Agonists: A Qualitative Study,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Objective:
To evaluate adult patients taking injectable GLP-1 agonists and identify barriers to adherence with the goal of developing targeted interventions that will improve patient understanding, adherence, and optimized health outcomes.

Background
There has been a significant surge in prescriptions for GLP-1 medications, such as Ozempic and Wegovy in recent years, both for diabetes treatment and weight management. Currently, seven agents are available either as oral or injectable formulations, including single-ingredient options and combinations with insulin. Due to their efficacy, pharmaceutical companies are expanding research into new formulations while struggling to meet current demand due to shortages of packaging and raw materials.  While it is known that manufacturer shortages are a common issue for these agents, it is important to identify other barriers that are involved from a patient perspective such as: patient understanding of proper administration, titration, or what to do once goals of therapy have been met. Previous research has often focused on surrogate markers such as a1c and weight vs medication cost which inevitably increases with long-term therapy. While it is evident that these medications are effective, it is important to ensure appropriate utilization and titration for optimal benefit to the patient and to continuous customer loyalty to H-E-B pharmacy as a company. Addressing barriers such as injection discomfort, side effects, cost concerns, lack of education, limited access to care, and social or cultural factors are vital to improving adherence. Enhanced patient education, counseling, and financial support strategies can significantly improve adherence rates and patient outcomes."
1206 Optimizing Diabetes Management: Enhancing Community Pharmacist Knowledge on Continuous Glucose Monitoring Devices,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The purpose of this study is to address the critical need for improved pharmacist knowledge on Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices. Hypoglycemia-related deaths often occur due to patients’ health illiteracy and incorrect use of point-of-care testing. Many individuals, particularly the elderly or those with limited health literacy, may benefit from CGM devices but lack the necessary guidance. By enhancing pharmacists’ understanding of CGMs, we aim to improve patient education, optimize diabetes management, and reduce adverse outcomes related to inadequate glucose monitoring."
1389 Impact of Social Media on Pharmacy's Professional Identity and Public Perception,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This study examines how social media, particularly TikTok and Instagram, shapes the public perception of the pharmacy profession and assesses whether these platforms provide an accurate portrayal of the pharmacy professional identity.
In recent years, declining admission rates in pharmacy schools have raised concerns about the profession's future. While factors such as job prospects, burnout, and limited opportunities for advancement have been studied, this research highlights a less-explored area by investigating how social media shapes public perceptions and influences the professional identity of pharmacists.
Platforms like TikTok and Instagram, which have significant influence on younger generations’ career choices, may not accurately reflect pharmacy's professional identity. This study evaluates whether these platforms provide an accurate and positive portrayal of the pharmacy profession, including its roles, responsibilities, and career opportunities. The findings related to the representation of pharmacy will be compared to other healthcare professions, including physician associates (PAs) and medical doctors (MDs), to assess how pharmacy is positioned within the broader medical field.
Prospective students often engage with social media when considering graduate programs, so a negative or misleading portrayal of pharmacy could be contributing to the declining admissions in pharmacy schools. This study aims to provide insight into how social media influences public perceptions and whether this aligns with the values promoted by pharmacy institutions. Ultimately, the findings could guide efforts to improve the online portrayal of pharmacy, potentially helping reverse the trend of declining admissions by offering a more compelling and accurate narrative."
1356 Utilizing Machine Learning Technology to Predict Acute Events in Patients Living in Long-term Care Facilities:  a Literature Review Analysis,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Objectives: To analyze the effectiveness of artificial intelligence-based predictive analytics in identifying various acute events in long-term care facilities such new onset delirium and fall risk in older adults. 

Background: 
Adults living in long-term care facilites are predisposed to a number of health risks such as, but not limited to delirium and fall risks. Delirium is a sudden and serious change in mental function that can affect a person's behavior and ability to function, often characterized by alteration of attention, consciousness, and cognition, with a reduced ability to focus, sustain or shift attention. This disorder is very prevalent among older adults, especially in long-term care settings, and is associated with increased mortality rates and can even lead to severe complications if not addressed in a timely manner. Another health issue often faced by adults in long-term care facilities is the risk of experiencing a fall. There are various factors that contribute to this risk including the physical equipment, as well as patient-specific conditions like dementia, visual impairment, and overall reduced mobility. With falls come a risk of broken bones, concussions, and other injuries which in a population who are more frail can bring about further complications. These combined with the growing scope of artificial intelligence, can give AI the potential to transform the way various events can be predicted and treated through enabling earlier diagnosis, personalizing treatment plans, and improving patient monitoring, to improve the quality of life and care for these patients."

1317 The intersection of artificial intelligence and evidence-based medicine: Perceptions and utilization among pharmacy students and faculty,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a scientific method of producing human-like information and facts from machines. These technologies are integrated into nearly all professions, including the field of pharmacy. AI can assist a pharmacist's practice with a multitude of tasks such as identification of drug related problems, error reduction, medication therapy management, etc. While many technology-based automated areas may benefit from AI, literature is limited regarding the intersection of AI and evidence-based medicine (EBM) practices among pharmacists. EBM is an important, and necessary skill implemented among practicing pharmacists; it is defined by the National Institute of Health (2022) as a “scientific method to organize and apply current data to improve healthcare decisions.” Currently, little is known about perceptions of AI among those in pharmacy as it relates to clinical decision-making, communication, and evidence-based approaches to patient care. As AI continues to be integrated in the pharmacy field, it is essential to understand the perceptions and utilizations of it in order to support good stewardship in shaping the next generation of pharmacists. The objective of this study is to survey student pharmacists and faculty about their views and utilization of AI, and their perceptions of AI as it relates to EBM, in order to better understand the intersection of AI and EBM in pharmacy practice."

1275 Evaluation of patients utilizing a web-based refill portal at a health-system specialty pharmacy,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This study aims to identify which patient populations within a health-system specialty pharmacy are using the web-based refill portal, and what strategies we can implement to enhance utilization. Patient portals allow patients to access information including recent visits, discharge summaries, medication lists, immunization history, lab results, and prescription requests etc. They have also expanded methods for refill management beyond traditional telephone and in-person requests. While some patients have started using the web-based refill portal since it was launched in 2022, there is an opportunity to enhance this process for specialty patients at a health-system specialty pharmacy.   Our goal is to identify patients using the web-based refill portal and to develop marketing and scripting to enhance utilization while ensuring a sustainable workflow to meet patient needs. 

The first objective is to define the number of prescriptions filled using a web-based refill portal in a health-system specialty pharmacy.  The second objective is to characterize the patient population utilizing the web-based refill portal for specialty medications. Patients will be characterized by age, disease state, insurance type, and provider specialty. The third objective is to implement targeted scripting and marketing strategies for patient education on the web-based refill portal for a specific specialty service and to optimize operational workflow to support this process. A future residency project will assess the impact of targeted scripting and marketing strategies on the web-based refill portal as there is not anticipated to be enough data to assess this year."

While the pharmacology of atypical antipsychotics is typically attributed to serotonin and dopamine receptor antagonism, we hypothesize that piperazine-containing antipsychotics also exhibit GABA receptor modulation. We performed a comprehensive literature search using the CAS SciFinder database to define the GABAa binding affinity of known piperazine-containing antipsychotics. A list of piperazine-containing compounds was compiled and utilized to perform a literature-based structure activity relationship (SAR) study. Our SAR suggests that the most potent GABAa blocker is pitrazepin, which includes piperazine conjugated to a triazole-anchored four ring system. To our surprise, neither the synthesis of pitrazepin nor a SAR of its structure have been reported in the literature. At present, we initiated the first total synthesis of pitrazepin and its analogues to characterize the GABAa pharmacology and antipsychotic potential of this molecular class."

Since their approval, LAI-ARVs have gained positive perception and high satisfaction among patients living with HIV (PLWH) due to advantages such as convenience, confidentiality, and reduced stigma.  

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the role of a clinical pharmacist in a LAI-ARV program by describing and quantifying approval/denial to the program after primary care provider (PCP) referral. The secondary objective is to quantify and qualify the clinical pharmacist interventions during HIV treatment/PrEP LAI program referral review. 

Although reports have shown promising clinical outcomes in PLWH, they have also highlighted the challenges of implementing LAI-ARV programs in interdisciplinary clinic settings, including delay in therapy initiation due to insurance denials, maintenance of patient adherence to injection appointments, and management of medication interactions and adverse effects. These studies showcase the need for interprofessional collaboration to improve overall patient health outcomes in LAI-ARV programs.

Pharmacist collaboration in oral ARV management programs has been shown to improve health outcomes by reducing inappropriate regimens, drug interactions, and adverse drug reactions while improving adherence and maintaining viral suppression in PLWH. One health system has implemented a pharmacist-led CAB management initiative showing quicker access to LAI-CAB and improved patient retention in the programs.

1347 Evaluation of Mixing Technologies for Small-Scale Preparation of Direct-Compressed Doxycycline Tablets,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Objective:
This study evaluates the effectiveness of three mixing technologies: Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM) technology, V-Blender, and Cube-Blender, in the production of direct-compressed doxycycline tablets with Prosolv® Easytab as the co-excipient of choice. 
Purpose:
Doxycycline (DOX) is tetracycline-member, broad-spectrum antibiotic widely used for the treatment of several infections including rickettsial infections, respiratory infections, and leptospirosis. More recently, The CDC has recommended the use of Doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis for some sexually transmitted infections within the first 72 hours after exposure. Doxycycline characteristics such as stickiness and sensitivity to light make it an ideal candidate for studying its blend uniformity and the effect on the final dosage form.   
The efficiency of the selected mixing technologies was evaluated for the blending of doxycycline for direct-compressed tablets. Doxycycline formulations were prepared as a binary combination of the drug and Prosolv ® Easytab. Easytab is a silicified microcrystalline cellulose co-excipient designed for direct compression tablets. The co-excipients are designed to be ready to use, making them suitable for direct compression, which only requires mixing the drug and the co-excipient for the time required. These characteristics make the co-excipients an alternative for the preparation of drug formulations, especially when compared to traditional methods such as wet and dry granulation. These methods are time consuming and require multiple processing steps for both the drug and the excipients. This project evaluated the preparation of formulas on a small scale that may be used for clinical manufacture and for the small production of custom sized batches."

1289 Impact of Electronic Medical Record Access on Prescription Turnaround Time at a Specialty Pharmacy,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of pharmacy access to outside patient electronic medical records (EMR) on the time required for prescription processing and insurance approval at a specialty pharmacy, with time to final medication dispensing evaluated as a secondary objective. Community pharmacists are responsible for ensuring the safe, effective, and appropriate use of medications. Lack of EMR access has been identified as a barrier to optimal patient care and may delay prior authorization approval when specific patient parameters (e.g. laboratory values) are required to be assessed and documented by the pharmacy. At select specialty pharmacy sites, pharmacists are granted access to the EMR of 7 specialty clinics in Tacoma and Seattle, Washington. EMR access allows pharmacies to directly gain knowledge about the patient’s health profile, which can be utilized throughout the medication fulfillment process including assessment of therapeutic indication and safety, drug utilization reviews, prior authorizations, and other steps that may otherwise result in delayed therapy. It is hypothesized that medication turnaround time will be faster when filling prescriptions from clinic sites allowing pharmacist EMR access compared to sites without EMR access."

Evaluation of Mixing Technologies for the Small-Scale Preparation of Direct-Compressed Doxycycline Tablets,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Objective:
This study evaluates the effectiveness of three mixing technologies: Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM) technology, V-Blender, and Cube-Blender, in the production of direct-compressed doxycycline tablets with Prosolv® Easytab as the co-excipient of choice. 

Purpose:
Doxycycline (DOX) is tetracycline-member, broad-spectrum antibiotic widely used for the treatment of several infections including rickettsial infections, respiratory infections, and leptospirosis. More recently, The CDC has recommended the use of Doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis for some sexually transmitted infections within the first 72 hours after exposure. Doxycycline characteristics such as stickiness and sensitivity to light make it an ideal candidate for studying its blend uniformity and the effect on the final dosage form.   
The efficiency of the selected mixing technologies was evaluated for the blending of doxycycline for direct-compressed tablets. Doxycycline formulations were prepared as a binary combination of the drug and Prosolv ® Easytab. Easytab is a silicified microcrystalline cellulose co-excipient designed for direct compression tablets. The co-excipients are designed to be ready to use, making them suitable for direct compression, which only requires mixing the drug and the co-excipient for the time required. These characteristics make the co-excipients an alternative for the preparation of drug formulations, especially when compared to traditional methods such as wet and dry granulation. These methods are time consuming and require multiple processing steps for both the drug and the excipients. This project evaluated the preparation of formulas on a small scale that may be used for clinical manufacture and for the small production of custom sized batches."
1270 Evaluating Provider Satisfaction with Clinical Pharmacist Delivered Chronic Care Management within an Accountable Care Organization,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this project is to assess provider perspectives of the role of the clinical pharmacist within the CCM model, access to a clinical pharmacist, and satisfaction with disease state impact and changes of care recommended by clinical pharmacists within an ACO. Chronic Care Management (CCM) involves coordinating comprehensive care for patients with multiple chronic conditions and focuses on addressing medical, functional, and psychosocial needs. This project reviews an independent pharmacy who has delivered clinical services with a local accountable care organization (ACO) for over 6 years. This collaboration has enabled clinical pharmacists to enhance patient care through medication expertise and patient relationships. Pharmacists facilitated communication with patients and care managers by remotely accessing electronic health records while providing the service. CCM services included reviewing medications and potential interactions, overseeing patient self-management of medications, coordinating care with home and community-based clinical services, and managing transitions of care."
1306 Pharmacist-mobile care clinic partnership to provide community-based health education & screenings in underserved communities.,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Objective/Background: The primary objective of this project is to promote health and wellness in underserved communities by providing health information and screenings for chronic diseases known to increase cardiovascular (CV) risk. Social determinants of health (SDOH) contribute to health disparities in underserved communities leading a higher prevalence of chronic disease and lower achievements of wellness. Members of these communities may not have access to health information, health screenings, and care. Accommodating the health needs of these underserved communities may be done by deploying mobile teams of healthcare providers to community hubs. Methods: We developed a partnership between clinical pharmacists, a provider of mobile care clinics (MCC), and a community-based organization (CBO) to develop health awareness and educational programs at community hubs (e.g., schools, libraries) in south suburban Chicago, emphasizing CV health and wellness. Pharmacists developed and delivered educational content on common CV risk factors (hypertension [HTN], diabetes mellitus [DM], dyslipidemia, and respiratory health), emphasizing health awareness and self-care. Beginning in May 2023, these were originally designed as townhall-style programs 30-60 minutes in duration to encourage engagement with attendees. Together with the MCC provider, the pharmacists also performed health screenings for HTN, DM, dyslipidemia, and/or respiratory disease over a 2-hour period at these community hubs. Members of the CBO assisted in identifying community sites and advertising the programs. For events scheduled after February 2024, we invited participants to complete anonymous surveys after each event and collected anonymous health screening data. Results: Since inception, 8 educational and/or health screening events were held at 3 different locations with mixed success. Townhall-style educational programs and subsequent screening events for faculty, staff, parents, and guardians at the p"

1236 A Community Pharmacy Collaborative Practice Agreement within an FQHC look-alike and its Impact on Healthcare Providers,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to describe and quantify the usage of a community-based pharmacy collaborative practice agreement (CPA) at 5 community pharmacies integrated within   an FQHC look-alike practice. The secondary objective is to evaluate the impact of the community pharmacy CPA on pharmacists and other providers in the practice. A pharmacy collaborative practice agreement, defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is an agreement between a prescriber and a pharmacist that designates a pharmacist to perform specific patient care activities. Though CPAs were legal in Ohio before 2016, Ohio legislators later passed a bill that allows multiple pharmacists to enter CPAs with multiple physicians for multiple patients improving access to pharmacist care. In 2021, Ohio law further expanded to include advanced nursing clinicians and physician assistants in addition to physicians in CPAs. Under a CPA, pharmacists can see patients, assess lab values as they pertain to drug therapy, and initiate, adjust, or discontinue medications for predefined disease states. In Ohio, pharmacists were also granted provider status by Medicaid, allowing for reimbursement for these services. CPAs in the community setting have been challenging to implement for several reasons including poor access to medical records, variable relationships with providers, and difficulty implementing into workflow. Community pharmacists across the United States have been successful when working collaboratively with test-to-treat strategies for influenza and streptococcal laryngitis, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV, and hormonal contraception. These agreements follow a strict protocol for the explicit patient care actions the pharmacist can take including the utilization of predetermined decision trees. Current literature does not examine a community pharmacy CPA which has a broad scope. This study takes place in five clinics in O"
1342 Assessing Precepting Pharmacists Perspectives on Pharmacy Students Use of Artificial Intelligence During Rotations,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study is to investigate the perspectives of precepting pharmacists on the utilization of generative artificial intelligence (AI) by pharmacy experiential students. Since 2022, generative AI has gained in popularity and mainstream use at a rapid pace with the launch of additional AI applications throughout 2023 and 2024. More platforms are integrating generative AI applications with endless features and possibilities to complete a wide variety of both simple and complex tasks. Generative AI has the potential to change educational systems, enhance workflows, and impact the future of patient care. However, due to its recent rise to mainstream use, there is limited research on the general knowledge, attitudes and practices of pharmacy students and pharmacists towards AI use in pharmacy practice, as well as discussion on the implications and integration of AI into education. As this recent technology becomes more prevalent and accessible, especially in its current state without standardized protocols for its use, it is crucial to understand the perspectives of precepting pharmacists on students utilizing generative AI during their rotations. Previous research has shown that most preceptors have limited direct experience with AI tools, and students lack knowledge of proper utilization and discernment which affects their ability to effectively utilize AI in clinical settings. There is a notable gap in the literature regarding precepting pharmacists’ perspectives on the use of generative AI by pharmacy students during their pharmacy experiential practice. The focus of current literature does not provide insight into their understanding and practical application of AI tools, including comprehensive training, impact assessment, hands-on experience, and curriculum development. This highlights the need for further research to specifically address precepting pharmacists’ perceptions with AI in the context of pharmacy education and practice. This study will"
"1077 Comparative Analysis of Vaccination Rates for COVID-19, Influenza, Pneumonia, and RSV Among Adults Aged 60+ in California",2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Primary Objective: Evaluate and compare vaccination rates of COVID-19, influenza, pneumonia, and RSV from 2022-2023 year in those older than 60 years of age in California. Older adults are more vulnerable to severe illness due to age-related immune decline, making vaccinations vital in preventing hospitalization and death. However, vaccination rates vary due to factors such as access, vaccine hesitancy, and evolving guidelines.

The COVID-19 pandemic emphasized the need for vaccinations in this population, with the CDC recommending booster doses to maintain immunity. Influenza remains a recurring seasonal threat, requiring annual vaccinations, particularly for older adults at higher risk of complications. Pneumococcal vaccines prevent bacterial pneumonia, and the introduction of an RSV vaccine in 2023 offers further protection for this age group. This analysis evaluates vaccination trends to improve public health outcomes for vulnerable populations."
1187 Evaluation of community pharmacy outreach events to screen for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objectives of this project are to: 1) assess perceived risk and knowledge of HIV for community event attendees, 2) assess perception of point of care testing for HIV in a community pharmacy, and 3) evaluate marketing effectiveness of community outreach events on HIV testing in community pharmacy.  

The rationale for the project is to use the accessibility of community pharmacists to expand community-based HIV testing. HIV is a disease transmitted through certain body fluids of people who are infected and although there is no cure, medications and early detection can help reduce the viral load, delay progression, and limit the spread. Even with the advancement of medications to help prevent HIV transmission, it continues to be a public health challenge. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends everyone between the ages of 13-64 years be tested for HIV at least once. Those who are at higher risk may benefit from testing more frequently. In 2018, the state pharmacy association partnered with the State Department of Health and Human Services to initiate HIV testing in high-risk counties and community pharmacies were one of the eligible providers."

"1023 Outpatient prescribing patterns in the treatment of insomnia, depression, and anxiety by prescriber type, specialty, and patient age group",2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to evaluate prescribing patterns among patients with depression, anxiety, and/or insomnia. Specifically, this work will characterize differences in drug selection and provision of diagnosis codes by prescriber type (mid-level practitioners versus physicians) and specialty. A secondary objective will evaluate drug selection by these prescriber groups among elderly patients with these three diseases. Current guidelines for pharmacological treatment of depression, anxiety, and insomnia recommend the use of various drug classes such as selective serotonin (+/- norepinephrine) reuptake inhibitors, anxiolytics, and/or sedatives-hypnotics. Despite availability of evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of these disorders, we suspect substantial variability of drug selection and dosing exists, particularly among elderly patients. Some literature exists that compares the prescribing habits of physicians versus mid-level providers in therapeutic areas such as pain management and diabetes. However, there is a lack of data comparing prescribing patterns among generalists (e.g. primary care, family practice, etc.) versus specialists (e.g. psychiatry, geriatrics, neurology, etc.) practitioners. There is also a lack of data analyzing prescribing patterns with established diagnoses and across patient populations with specified characteristics, such as patient age. This work will explore prescribing patterns for the treatment of depression, anxiety, and/or insomnia in the outpatient setting."
1264 Enhancing Medication Adherence and Therapy Optimization: The Impact of Pharmacist-Driven Medication Assessment of Injectable Tirzepatide,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this investigation is to evaluate the impact of early pharmacist intervention on medication adherence among patients prescribed injectable tirzepatide for the indication of type II diabetes. Specifically, this project aims to assess the frequency and duration of gaps in therapy in patients receiving early intervention versus standard refill reminders, as well as identify factors influencing adherence during supply shortages, such as cost, adverse effects, or perceived lack of efficacy.
The global healthcare system increasingly faces critical challenges due to supply shortages of essential medications. These shortages jeopardize patient outcomes, complicate treatment regimens, and exacerbate health disparities. When shortages occur, supply and demand become unbalanced, leaving patients who were previously initiated on the therapy at risk of not having access to their medication. Instead of being able to titrate and optimize their treatment, these patients are left facing uncertainty about how to secure their next prescription.
Pharmacists play a critical role in addressing these challenges by proactively assessing prescriptions in outpatient settings. By actively engaging with patients, pharmacists can recognize issues such as medication shortages, high costs, or difficulty in understanding dosing instructions. They can implement solutions like medication switching to a more accessible formulation, adjusting doses to improve efficacy or reduce costs, and providing resources or assistance programs to alleviate financial burdens. By personalizing care strategies and fostering open communication, pharmacists play a vital role in ensuring patients remain adherent to their prescribed therapies, ultimately improving health outcomes."
1006 Comparison of 10-year risk utilizing the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Estimator Plus versus the Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disea,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study is to determine if there is a change in patients’ calculated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk category based on the American Heart Association’s (AHA) Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Events (PREVENT) calculator as compared to the American College of Cardiology’s (ACC) ASCVD Risk Estimator Plus for patients who recently initiated a statin at a federally qualified health center (FQHC). The 2019 ACC/AHA guideline for the primary prevention of ASCVD recommends using the pooled cohort equations to estimate ASCVD risk over 10 years for asymptomatic adults aged 40 to 75. These equations are race- and sex-specific, categorizing adults into risk categories: low risk (<5%), borderline (5% to <7.5%), intermediate (≥7.5% to <20%), or high risk (≥20%). These categories guide therapy recommendations. The guidelines note that the equation is most validated for non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks in the United States, and may result in over or underestimation for other racial and ethnic groups. The 2023 PREVENT calculator addresses this by removing race as a factor and incorporating kidney function. There are limited studies to confirm whether the differences in the calculators necessitates a change in patient’s recommended therapy."

All 50 states have laws allowing pharmacists to dispense it without a prescription, yet its availability and pharmacist counseling remain suboptimal. In March 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved an over-the-counter (OTC) nasal spray formulation of naloxone to improve access in pharmacies. Pharmacists are encouraged to dispense OTC naloxone and provide counseling on its purpose, administration, and potential side effects. However, little is known about the availability of OTC naloxone or the counseling provided in community pharmacies.
The objectives of this study are to (a) examine the availability of OTC naloxone in Georgia pharmacies, (b) assess community pharmacists’ provision of counseling when dispensing OTC naloxone, and (c) evaluate the differences in counseling provided when pharmacists encounter engaged versus less-engaged individuals seeking OTC naloxone."

Community pharmacies continue to advance medication management services for their patients to optimize patient treatment regimens and overall health outcomes. To facilitate expansion of enhanced patient care services, many community pharmacies around the country have organized to form clinically integrated networks. The Pennsylvania Pharmacists Care Network (PPCN) is a statewide clinically integrated network of over 200 community pharmacies across the commonwealth. In 2022, PPCN established a contract with a Medicaid MCO to provide enhanced services to qualifying patient members. Some of these services include medication synchronization, medication reconciliation, medication adherence packaging, home medication delivery, naloxone dispensing and education, and COVID-19 vaccinations. PPCN pharmacists document these services in the Pharmacist eCare Plan (PeCP) to facilitate longitudinal patient care and for reimbursement purposes. To date, PPCN has only utilized PeCP data to characterize the services network pharmacies provide.

1021 Methamphetamine-induced sensitization in male mice lacking regulator of G-protein signaling 2,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This study aims to assess the role of the regulator of G-protein signaling 2 (RGS2) in methamphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization in adult male mice. Methamphetamine is a potent psychostimulant and the abuse of methamphetamine has significantly increased over the last decade. Currently, there are no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of methamphetamine addiction. Thus, identifying novel targets for the treatment of methamphetamine addiction is essential. Repeated intermittent administration of methamphetamine can produce augmented response to methamphetamine, which is commonly referred to as a sensitized behavioral response. Sensitized response to drugs of abuse is believed to be responsible for persistent drug seeking, craving, and psychopathology associated with drugs of abuse. Behavioral sensitization is essentially a manifestation of long-lasting neuroadaptations in brain circuits. Neural substrates playing a role in development or expression of methamphetamine-induced sensitization are not fully understood and could serve as potential targets for the treatment of methamphetamine addiction. Methamphetamine-induced behavioral effects are mediated by dopamine that acts via the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The functioning of GPCRs is negatively regulated by regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins. Previous work from our laboratory showed that deletion of RGS2 did not influence the rewarding effects of methamphetamine as assessed using the conditioned place preference model. We also previously reported that increase in locomotor activity after acute administration of methamphetamine was not affected by deletion of RGS2 in male adult mice. However, the effects of deletion of RGS2 in male mice on methamphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization after repeated administration of methamphetamine has not been studied. This study aimed to address this gap in knowledge."

Since March 2022, GLP-1RAs have been experiencing supply shortages causing barriers for patients who are utilizing these medications for glycemic control, weight loss, and/or cardiovascular health. Medication shortages have resulted in patients struggling to obtain their medication, potentially leading to a negative impact on their health care goals. Further, many have been forced to seek alternative sources to acquire their medication increasing the potential risk of adverse effects due to the quality and variability of the product. Given the shortages, prescribers often switch patients to other medications in the same class. Pharmacists are faced with the task of evaluating the dosing conversions and dispensing the medications. However, some pharmacists may not feel comfortable with the titration or equivalent dose conversions amongst the GLP-1RAs. Pharmacists in the community pharmacy setting must be properly educated on how to provide safe and effective care while supporting their patients receiving GLP-1RAs using the existing evidence-based guidance."

Recent epidemiological data indicate that 59.3 million (23.1%) U.S. adults were diagnosed with a mental illness, yet only 50.6% accessed mental health services within the past year. Similar barriers to care exist for individuals with other BH issues, such as substance use disorders, and SDOH needs. Pharmacists, as accessible healthcare professionals, are uniquely positioned to address this public health challenge through medication management, patient education, and collaborative care models. In response to this, we created a 14-hour continuing education program targeted towards behavioral health and SDOH called Behavioral Health Pharmacy Advocates (BHPA)."
Impact of Pharmacist-led Education on New York Dental Provider’s Attitudes Towards Immunizations Practices,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to assess whether a pharmacist-delivered continuing education (CE) lecture will have an impact on the willingness and confidence of New York State dental providers in administering vaccines and allowing pharmacists to provide vaccinations in dental settings. The secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of this educational lecture on providers' personal beliefs about vaccinations.  Vaccinations are pivotal in preventing diseases such as human papillomavirus (HPV), influenza, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the community setting, pharmacists provide vital immunization services and offer vaccine-related guidance. Pharmacists’ involvement in providing vaccinations is well-established, while dental offices, frequently visited by patients, provide an ideal setting for vaccine education and potential administration. Although several states have expanded the scope of dental providers to provide vaccinations for patients, New York State currently does not give dental providers this authority. Dental providers and pharmacists typically operate independently, though both serve key public health roles. To our knowledge, studies recognizing the benefits of pharmacist-delivered vaccine education for dental providers are not well documented. Additionally, literature identifying opportunities for pharmacists to collaborate with dental providers to promote or administer vaccinations in dental settings is currently limited."

In response to the increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), pharmacist driven collaborative drug therapy management (CDTM) clinics with a focus on diabetes are expanding. Pharmacists are able to independently prescribe therapy following guidelines determined by collaborative practice agreements with physicians. With T2DM treatment guidelines favoring GLP-1 RA products, there has been a substantial increase in demand and use of GLP-1 RA products including the traditional GLP-1 RAs, dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 receptors agonists, and combination products of GLP-1 RAs with insulin. In clinical practice, patients may switch from one GLP-1 RA product to another due to medication backorders, side effects and/or intolerance, and insurance or patient preferences, yet there is limited published data on the reason and frequency for switching. This study aims to expand upon current literature to investigate the switching patterns between GLP-1 RA products, in terms of how many patients tend to change therapies, and characterize the reasons for switching agents. Secondary endpoints will investigate if reasons for switching products led to differences in adherence, measured by average percent days covered (PDC)."

In March 2024, Pennsylvania pharmacists were recognized as providers and authorized to enroll in the state Medicaid program and offer reimbursable services like medication therapy management, evaluation and management, tobacco cessation counseling, point-of-care tests, and diabetes self-management education (1,2). With over 3 million Pennsylvania residents on Medicaid, including 1 in 6 adults and 3 in 8 children, this presents a valuable opportunity for pharmacists to develop sustainable pharmacy services (3).  Despite the 25,000 licensed pharmacists in Pennsylvania, fewer than 400 are currently enrolled as Medicaid providers. Barriers may include a lack of education on the enrollment process and confusion about billing pathways. Previous practice transformation projects in Pennsylvania successfully empowered SPs to develop and manage clinical services under pharmacist supervision. Building on that success, this new initiative aims to utilize the help of SPs to support pharmacist navigation through Medicaid enrollment and expand services in high-need areas.

1292 Impact of Psychiatric Multimorbidity on Oral Anticoagulant Shared Decision Making in Older Adults with Atrial Fibrillation,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is a common cardiac arrhythmia of irregular rate and rhythm that increases the risk of stroke and often requires anticoagulation as a part of management therapy. Among those living with AF almost 40% live with co-occurring depression, anxiety or cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment, anxiety and depression in AFib is associated with increased symptom burden and a decreased quality of life. Further, anxiety and depression may worsen atrial fibrillation symptoms through decreased medication compliance, or mechanistically through oxidative stress, inflammation, autonomic nerve function. There is evidence that increased patient engagement through shared decision making (SDM) results in a better understanding of medication therapy and the importance of adherence which subsequently may result in decreased risk of bleeding, stroke and mortality. Although about 61% of adults with AFib engage in SDM, older participants are less likely to engage in SDM. While there is evidence that SDM improves patient knowledge of OAC therapy choices and patient outcomes and satisfaction, whether the subset of at-risk older adults with psychiatric multimorbidity engage in SDM is unclear. We hypothesize that psychiatric multimorbidity will negatively impact engagement in shared decision making."

1229 From Policy to Patients: Impact of the Colorado Insulin Affordability Program,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"To assess the utilization of the Colorado Insulin Affordability Program, empower pharmacists to implement the act for eligible patients by providing an educational tool, and evaluate the impact on social determinants of health. Insulin affordability had been a persistent issue leading to poor outcomes in the United States until recently with some relief from several health policies and co-pay caps, leading to later voluntary price reductions by several manufactures. Colorado was the first state to address increasing insulin prices in 2020, capping the out-of-pocket costs at $100 per 30 day supply for insured patients. Furthermore, the Insulin Affordability Program provides lower maximum cost at $35 for an emergency 30 day supply in a 12 month period. While the program establishes cost caps for eligible patients, it does not mandate automatic enrollment or proactive pharmacist involvement, leaving enrollment dependent on patient awareness and initiative. As a result, gaps in utilization persist, particularly in community pharmacy settings where pharmacists are uniquely positioned to bridge this gap and assist patients in accessing affordable insulin. This study seeks to evaluate the implementation and utilization of the Colorado Insulin Affordability Program in a large community grocery store pharmacy chain, focusing on optimizing pharmacist knowledge and involvement in identifying eligible patients. By providing streamlined educational tools and resources, this intervention aims to improve the act's utilization and assess its broader impact on patient care and social determinants of health."

1219 The impact of integrating a pharmacist into postpartum hypertension management,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This study aims to detail the integration, perception, and impact of a clinical pharmacist’s involvement in postpartum hypertension monitoring and management, as well as review how the service can help bridge known health disparity gaps.  Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) affect approximately 10% of all pregnancies.  Half of these women will remain hypertensive after pregnancy, and approximately 10% of normotensive women develop de novo hypertension postpartum.  Furthermore, it has been well documented that women belonging to minority groups are more likely to experience HDP and less likely to attend in-person postpartum follow-up visits.  Literature suggests that the implementation of telehealth services helps to bridge the health care disparity gap by improving appointment adherence rates of minority women to nearly match their white counterparts.  A previous study demonstrated optimization of provider time and more timely medication initiation and adjustment with pharmacist involvement in postpartum antihypertensive management.  This study aims to incorporate a pharmacist into the postpartum care team to enhance care and expand pharmacist services within one healthcare team."
1230 Implementing Long-Acting Injectable (LAI) Medications in a Comprehensive Strategy for Opioid Abstinence,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Objectives: This project aims to implement a Long-Acting Injectable (LAI) service for patients prescribed treatment for substance use disorder (SUD) at the Turning Point Treatment Center (TPTC) in collaboration with MercyOne Dubuque Medical Center Pharmacy. The objectives are to: 1) Describe the development and implementation of the LAI medication service, including barriers, facilitators, and staff roles; and 2) Assess patient satisfaction with the LAI service. Current treatments of SUD depend on oral medications which can contribute to the burden of daily dosing, stigma, forgetfulness, and logistical issues like frequent clinic visits. These factors can negatively impact patient adherence and satisfaction. Transitioning eligible patients to monthly LAI medications presents an opportunity to improve patient outcomes by reducing the daily administration burden, extending time between clinic visits, and potentially enhancing adherence, and patient satisfaction."

Evaluation of Mixing Technologies for the Small-Scale Preparation of Direct-Compressed Doxycycline Tablets,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Objective:
This study compares the efficiency of three mixing technologies, namely, Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM) technology, V-Blender, and Cube-Blender in the preparation of doxycycline tablets using ProSolv ® Easytab (P-ET) as the co-excipient of choice for a direct compression process. The small scale may be used for clinical manufacture and for the small production of custom sized batches. The idea is to use scalable technologies for eventual commercial manufacture.

Purpose:
Doxycycline (DOX) is tetracycline-member, broad-spectrum antibiotic widely used for the treatment of several infections including rickettsial infections and respiratory infections. More recently, The CDC has recommended the use of Doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis for some sexually transmitted infections in the first 72 hours after exposure. The drug is also the first line of treatment for leptospirosis, an infectious disease that is prevalent in tropical weathers particularly during the rainy seasons.  The drug tends to be sticky and is unstable in the presence of light. This makes it a suitable candidate for the study as it represents a good formulation challenge for the study.   
This study is intended to determine which of the three technologies provide the faster mixing time to prepare direct-compressed tablets using P-ET as the excipient of choice. This excipient is a co-excipient of silicified microcrystalline cellulose designed for direct compression tablets. The formulation was designed as binary mixture of drug and excipient which reduces the preparation time and facilitates mixing of blends as compared to more traditional technologies such as wet and dry granulation processes that require more processing steps and a larger combination of ingredients in the formula."
1143 Safer Scenes for Music City: Increasing Naloxone Education and Access at Tennessee Music Venues,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"In a 2021 report, Oxford Economics stated that the live music and entertainment industry had an economic impact of over $132 billion annually in the United States. In the Nashville-area alone the music industry supports more than 56,000 jobs, $3.2 billion in annual labor income, and over $5.5 billion to the local economy. With the music industry playing such an integral role in the economic success of Nashville -The Music City- and the state of Tennessee as a whole, it is important to ensure the safety of patrons attending music events. 

Per the National Institute of Health (NIH), deaths due to opioid overdose more than tripled in the decade between 2012 and 2022. With the rise of opioid abuse, the risks associated with synthetic opioids, and the increased prevalence of drug use at live music events, the risk of opioid-related harm to attendees is high. Harm reduction strategies such as naloxone education and training and drug testing practices have been implemented at some music events, but the need for further harm reduction at music venues, concerts, and festivals remains. How can pharmacists and student pharmacists leverage their knowledge and relationships to increase access to naloxone kits and knowledge for concert-goers?"

1179 Effectiveness of Glycemic Control Education Delivered by a Community-Based Pharmacy Practice Resident,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This study's aim is to evaluate patients' knowledge on the use of blood glucose monitors (BGMs) and continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). The goal is to assess improvement in glycemic control through pharmacist provided education, the patient's ability to use a CGM/BGM device and the knowledge gained after the education-based intervention and retained at 14-day follow-up.  Patients’ knowledge of glycemic variability (GV) and time in range (TIR), diabetes management, and ability to use CGM/BGM devices before and after the intervention will be assessed.
We are looking to answer the following research questions: 
1. What is the self-reported ability to use and manage a BGM/CGM device among patients at
baseline, immediately after the education-based intervention, and at a 14-day follow-up
appointment? 
2. What is the self-reported understanding and retention of diabetes management and glycemic variability and time in range concepts at baseline, immediately after the education-based intervention, and at a 14-day follow-up appointment?
3. What is the level of satisfaction from the patient on the service provided by the pharmacist?
Diabetes is a highly prevalent and a highly comorbid disease state, resulting in various macro and microvascular complications. In recent years, with growing evidence and technology in diabetes care, disease management approaches have expanded the clinical focus to include adjunct glycemic targets such as GV and TIR.[1] Due to the novelty of new glycemic targets patients remain unaware and struggle with understanding goals and appropriate ways of managing their diabetes.  Historically, BGMs have been crucial tools helping patients monitor and manage blood glucose levels effectively. With advancing technologies, such as storage capability and computational analyses, BGMs advantage continues to expand as it allows patients to monitor GV and TIR as well. [2] On the other hand, the use of CGMs has been shown to significantly reduce A1c levels, help improve TIR and GV, and optimize patients’ glucometabolic control. [3] As such, the use of CGMs and their simplistic yet comprehensive reports as an adjunct tool to diabetes management has been increasing in practice.  Both CGMs and BGMs can provide valuable information on patients’ current glycemic picture which can further guide a personalized approach to patients’ pharmacological therapies. Unfortunately, many patients still struggle with access, proper initiation, use, and functions of CGMs and BGMs. Recognizing this problem, as some of the most accessible members of the healthcare team, community-based pharmacists can make impactful interventions through patient education and close follow-up."

1321 Assessing Patient Satisfaction with Pharmacist-Led Continuous Glucose Monitor Education Services in the Community Pharmacy Setting,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to assess patient satisfaction with a pharmacist-led CGM education service focused on addressing barriers of optimal CGM use. The secondary objective is Identify additional barriers to implementing a pharmacist-led CGM education service in the community pharmacy setting.  The implementation of technology in the management of diabetes improves the lives of patients with Type 1 and 2 Diabetes, with self-monitoring blood glucose monitors being the standard of care. Recently, continuous blood glucose monitors (CGMs) have become an increasingly popular option amongst clinicians and patients due to their convenience, improved accuracy, and breadth of data supplied. This rise in popularity has resulted in increased utilization of CGMs in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes by significant margins. With plans for CGMs to become available for over-the-counter purchase, the overall utilization of CGMs is expected to continue increasing. However, barriers such as age, health literacy, language, and cost may prevent a seamless and satisfactory user experience for a significant portion of CGM users. 
  
Previous research has demonstrated that patient education in the use of CGMs is vital for positive health outcomes in the management of Diabetes. However, the methodology of how to implement a service that addresses these barriers remains to be determined. Community Pharmacists are well positioned to provide this education and to address these barriers, as they often have the most opportunities to provide the most timely education prior to starting the device. This study aims to evaluate this educational gap by assessing patients’ satisfaction with a CGM educational service provided by the pharmacist and their overall confidence in using their monitors after receiving the service. Additionally, this study hopes to identify the barriers and financial viability for implementing this service as well as gauging patient interest."

However, there is limited research on the optimal dosing of buprenorphine/naloxone in the adolescent and young adult population. This retrospective study aims to analyze the dosing patterns of buprenorphine/naloxone in adolescents with OUD at the Mason and Partners Clinic to inform future clinical pharmacy practice. Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to examine the dosing patterns of buprenorphine/naloxone in adolescents aged 14-21 years old with OUD who have participated in the protocol in the past 5 years between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2023. The secondary objective is to assess the relationship between Suboxone dosage and treatment outcomes, such as adherence to the therapy protocol and positive Urine Drug Screen (UDS) for buprenorphine."
1054 Measuring 4-year pharmacy student success rate,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study is to define a new metric for student success by combining 4-year graduation rates with first time North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX) and Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination (MPJE) pass rates. The landscape of pharmacy education has undergone notable shifts in recent years, this is indicated by the precipitous drop in passing rates of the NAPLEX and MPJE. Declining pass rates may be linked to the decreasing number of applicants, less stringent admission standards. This has given students more leverage in selecting their pharmacy schools. Programs may maintain their matriculation numbers at the expense of quality. Lower admission standards could result in students who are less academically prepared, potentially leading to higher attrition rates and lower licensure examination pass rates. Although much has been written about NAPLEX pass rates, little data includes consideration of it within the context of the other variables. Without programs providing clear and reliable metrics, potential students may have a difficult time assessing the quality of many programs. Providing comprehensive statistics of 4-year student success would not only benefit prospective students to make informed decisions about their education but also help schools make better decisions about enrollment and allocation of resources."
1012 Examining factors that increase the risk association of pancreatic cancer diagnosis in the Black community,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most significantly aggressive and deadly forms of cancer. When comparing incidence of death, pancreatic cancer is the 7th leading cancer. While cancers affect people of all populations, pancreatic cancer diagnosis is found to have the most severe impact among the black community. The mortality rates of pancreatic cancer can in some cases be attributed to its delayed diagnosis, as many patients are in the advanced stages once it is discovered due to lack of symptom presence until it has started to impact other organs. This is most often the case for black patients. This study aims to examine factors that increase the risk association of pancreatic cancer diagnosis in the Black community."
1225 Demonstrating the Value of Pharmacy Interns in Improving Value Based Care Star Ratings in a Federally Qualified Health Center,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This study explores the role of pharmacy interns in improving Electronic Health Record (EHR) workflows to expand outreach efforts for patients with uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM) at a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC). We hypothesize that pharmacy interns can significantly impact value-based care outcomes by contributing to EHR workflows, improving chronic disease management, and enhancing the organization’s star ratings. FQHCs provide care to diverse populations, regardless of insurance status, making value-based care integration critical for improving patient outcomes and financial performance. High star ratings reflect quality of care, attracting more patients and higher reimbursement rates. Clinical pharmacist interventions, under collaborative practice agreements (CPA), are well-documented in improving outcomes through personalized treatment plans and ongoing monitoring."
1297 Naloxone Distribution by a Pharmacist in a Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Clinic within a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC),2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This study investigates the impact of a pharmacist-led naloxone distribution program within a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) Substance Use Disorder (SUD) clinic. The opioid crisis continues to devastate communities across the United States, with opioids accounting for over 75% of drug overdose deaths in 2021. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is critical for reversing overdoses, but access remains a significant barrier, particularly for vulnerable populations. A pharmacist-led program addresses this gap by providing at-risk patients with both naloxone and education on its use. The primary objective of this study is to assess how the program improved naloxone accessibility by measuring the percentage of eligible patients who obtained naloxone before and after the implementation of the pharmacist-driven protocol."
1138 From Classroom to Community: Student Pharmacists Utilize Mental Health First Aid Training in a Depression Screening Program,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"With the increasing prevalence of mental illness in the United States (U.S.), there is a need to close the gap in care for patients with untreated mental health conditions. The evolving role of community pharmacists in mental healthcare offers a unique opportunity to expand patient care services, as 90% of U.S. adults live within five miles of a pharmacy. However, many pharmacists lack sufficient training to confidently and efficiently engage in mental health conversations with patients. Thus, training student pharmacists will equip them with the skills needed to provide mental health interventions as they become practice ready. Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) is one of many training opportunities for healthcare professionals. Although there is evidence that mental health training can improve student pharmacist knowledge and confidence, it remains unknown if mental health training coupled with real-world application can further enhance these skills. The objective of this study was to assess student pharmacist knowledge and confidence in navigating mental health conversations after MHFA training alone versus MHFA training coupled with community pharmacy-based depression screening experiences."
1350 Healthcare Professionals� Perception of CGM Use in an Obesity Medicine Clinic: A Pilot Study,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The purpose of this research project is to assess healthcare professionals’ (HCPs) perception of using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices in an obesity medicine practice. The use of CGMs in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes using insulin has significantly expanded in the past decade. CGMs have now entered the over-the-counter (OTC) market as affordable biosensors, providing expanded access to other patient populations, including those with obesity. Use of the new OTC biosensor devices may provide both HCPs and patients valuable insights into diet and lifestyle behaviors and their impact on health. Based on excellent outcomes of CGM use in patients with diabetes and initial research that suggests potential benefits in obesity medicine practice, it is important to explore perceptions of healthcare professionals in this field. Additionally, educating obesity medicine HCPs about CGM and biosensor use, benefits, and challenges is important to integrating this valuable tool into obesity medicine practice."
1170 Assessing Proficiency and Perspectives of the Over-The-Counter Norgestrel Hormonal Oral Contraceptive Among Community Pharmacy Patrons in Mississippi,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Objective: 
This project aims to assess the proficiency and perspectives of the norgestrel pill use amongst community pharmacy patrons in Mississippi and Louisiana. 

Background:
The expansion of women’s healthcare in the United States has been a major topic of concern. The 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe vs. Wade significantly altered women’s reproductive rights at the state and federal level. The norgestrel pill is the first FDA approved daily oral contraceptive in the U.S. accessible without a prescription. Although there is a huge push to increase women’s reproductive rights and overall access to healthcare, unguided access to this medication can pose potential concerns for consumers. Unlike combination oral contraceptives, the over-the-counter product contains one active ingredient of synthetic progestogen. Its unique chemical composition permits a three-hour window for missed doses before risking pregnancy. Assessing one’s understanding of this over-the-counter oral contraceptive pill can help identify key areas for education or consultation that provides for appropriate product use. Pharmacists serve an integral role in patient care and education. Counseling conducted at the pharmacy may reduce undesirable outcomes patients can experience including unwanted pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, irregular menstrual patterns, and other side effects."
1280 Frequency and Characteristics of Patient Information Requests Made by Community Pharmacists During the Delivery of Medication Therapy Management Servi,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of the study is to characterize patient information requests made by community pharmacists during the delivery of MTM services for a self-insured employer.

Medication Therapy Management (MTM) services promote medication therapy problem (MTP) identification, leading to improved patient health outcomes. Previous studies have identified pharmacists’ information needs both during MTM delivery and routine prescription fulfillment. For example, community pharmacists report needing access to laboratory data, progress notes, and updated medication lists. Because community pharmacists do not routinely have access to electronic health records (EHRs), patient information requests (i.e., requesting patient-related information from another healthcare provider because it is necessary for service provision) commonly occur via telephone or fax with a physician’s office. While faxed EHR data to pharmacists results in increasing the identification of MTPs, faxing records is inefficient. Providing pharmacists with access to the EHR would be a step forward. However, community pharmacists would need to access multiple EHRs to identify MTPs as pharmacies share mutual patients with physicians using various EHR platforms. Therefore, prior research has laid the foundation for the potential for health information exchange (HIE) because HIEs facilitate the exchange of data from multiple healthcare facilities and EHRs. However, critical knowledge gaps remain. In 2024, Purdue University expanded access to MTM for all  health plan members via collaboration with Clarest Health and their network of 450 community pharmacies in Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated patient information requests made in delivering MTM services to patients under a self-insured employer health plan. Identifying patient information requests that occur during the provision of MTM for Purdue health plan members would further our understanding of the potential value of HIE access for community pharmacists."
1281 Frequency and characteristics of prescription adaptations made by chain community pharmacists,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study is to determine the frequency and characteristics of minor prescription adaptations requested by chain community pharmacists. 
Community pharmacists are among the most accessible medical professionals; however, community pharmacists are also commonly considered to be underutilized. Collaborative drug therapy management (CDTM) agreements are used between pharmacists and prescribers to delegate increased responsibility over medication optimization to pharmacists. Specifically, CDTM agreements can include one or more of the following: 1) initiate, modify, or discontinue drug therapy, 2) order and interpret laboratory tests, and 3) monitor patients on control of chronic conditions. CDTM has resulted in significant improvements in patient outcomes and pharmacist and physician efficiency. Prescribers’ workload continues to grow, and pharmacists have the clinical knowledge and training to relieve their workload regarding prescription optimization. The ability for chain community pharmacists to make minor prescription adaptations would minimize workflow burden at pharmacies and prescriber offices. Currently, all 50 states and the District of Columbia permit various CDTM protocols in practice. However, establishing a CDTM agreement with every provider with whom a community pharmacist has mutual patients would not be practical. Unfortunately, Indiana pharmacists do not have the authority to make minor prescription adaptations outside of an established CDTM, unlike Idaho. According to Idaho pharmacy law, pharmacists are allowed to make minor prescription adaptations without established CDTM agreements. There are studies that establish the benefit for pharmacists to engage in CDTM; however, the frequency and characteristics of minor prescription adaptations requested by chain community pharmacists during routine practice is unknown. This information could help inform future legislation permitting prescription adaptations."
1386 Evaluation of Reproductive Health Literacy Amongst College Students,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study is to evaluate college students' health literacy on sexual/ reproductive health and how it affects choices of contraceptive methods. 
Health literacy is defined as the knowledge or understanding of resources to make health-related decisions and having the ability to make use of those resources. Throughout the years studies have shown the health literacy rate to be lower than the literacy rate across the United States. Health literacy gives patients the information they need to make decisions and ensures patients make the appropriate decisions for their health at home. 
Reproductive health literacy is important regarding different topics such as knowledge on contraception and fertility, planned pregnancies, cervical cancer screening, sexually transmitted diseases, and pregnancy postpartum outcomes.3 In previous studies, those with low health literacy were found to identify knowledge as a barrier to using contraceptives correctly, including emergency contraceptives, not knowing when in a menstruation cycle they are most likely to become pregnant, higher rates of unprotected sex, and more unplanned pregnancies.1 Among college students, low health literacy can lead to adverse reproductive health outcomes at a higher rate than other age groups, due to an increased prevalence of risky sexual behavior and exploration of sexuality.2  It is also found that those who are pregnant or already parents face greater obstacles in graduating college within six years and have a greater incidence of drop-out rates.3  The rationale for this study was to further build upon the findings of previous studies on reproductive health literacy amongst college students in a post-Covid setting. A cross-sectional, anonymous survey was distributed to the student body, which sought to assess barriers to contraceptive access and possible areas of intervention."
1176 Driving Behavior Change through a Pharmacist-Led Smoking Cessation Program via Mobile Health Units,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Approximately 46 million adults in the United States report using a tobacco product and about half (23 million) report nicotine dependence. Michigan remains one of the highest prevalence states of cigarette smokers and ENDS users. Mobile health units (MHU) offer a novel way to address a need for preventative healthcare services, including a pharmacist-led smoking cessation program, for an urban underserved patient population. Behavior factors that influence the success of smoking cessation include the perceived importance of quitting, confidence and readiness to quit, smoking triggers, and physical dependence on nicotine. The Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) measures the intensity of physical dependence of nicotine and the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) of Behavior Change assesses a patient’s readiness to quit. The objective of this ongoing pilot study is to utilize these tools to describe the behavior change factors of participants in a MHU pharmacist-led smoking cessation program in an urban underserved community."
1109 Co-Designing Solutions: A Participatory Approach to Supporting Oral Anticancer Medication Use in Breast Cancer,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study was to co-design an early prototype intervention to support the medication management needs of patients with breast cancer. As the use of oral anticancer medications (OAMs) increases for the treatment of breast cancer, patients face challenges with medication management that lead to suboptimal adherence. Historically, interventions developed to support use of OAMs have had limited effectiveness, often because they did not account for the specific context of the end-users, the patients. Engaging patients as active participants in the development process will help to ensure that the intervention is tailored to their specific needs and preferences."

1366 Assessing Same-day Availability of Naloxone in North Carolina Pharmacies,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is a lifesaving drug that is effective at reversing an opioid overdose. As the opioid crisis continues to be a major public health issue, increasing access to naloxone has been an important step to mitigate potential opioid overdose deaths. The North Carolina statewide standing order for naloxone was implemented in August 2015 to increase accessibility without the need for an individual prescription. Recently, over-the-counter (OTC) naloxone was approved in March 2023. As efforts to increase access continue to grow, it is important to evaluate if pharmacies stock naloxone, especially for those who live in rural areas with limited access to care. For pharmacies that do not stock naloxone, little is known about whether they direct people to other resources where they can obtain naloxone. Our objective is to describe the differences in naloxone availability among North Carolina pharmacies and determine whether pharmacies that do not stock naloxone refer individuals to other naloxone resources."

1011 Evaluation of Factors Affecting Immunologic and Virologic Function among Reincarcerated Individuals Living with HIV in the Illinois Department of Corr,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"A previous retrospective study of individuals in custody at the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) revealed that the proportion of participants who were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and virologically suppressed decreased from 73% at release to 49.7% upon reincarceration. These findings suggest that individuals often face significant challenges in accessing or continuing their HIV care and treatment after release. Key factors that may contribute to challenges post-release include mental illness, substance use, housing instability, access to transportation, lapses in employment and health insurance coverage, and stigma. Identifying factors that may be related to incomplete virologic suppression may allow for targeted interventions to improve the transition between custody and release to the community. 

The objective of this study is to identify factors influencing loss of virologic suppression among individuals living with HIV who are reincarcerated in IDOC. Currently, upon incarceration into IDOC, individuals with HIV follow-up with the University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System (UI Health) telemedicine clinic, which consists of infectious diseases (ID) physicians, ID clinical pharmacists, a social worker, outreach worker, and an on-site nurse to assist in conducting the visit. In preparation for and after release, the social worker provides resources to assist with medical insurance, HIV follow-up, employment, and housing."

1373 Developing RNA-based therapeutics for breast cancer,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study is to design and optimize antisense based molecules to target protein kinase B known as AKT for therapeutic use in Breast cancer. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy diagnosed in women. AKT or protein kinase B is a serine threonine kinase that regulates biological functions in body. In breast cancer, two isoforms of AKT-AKT1 and AKT2 are often mutated. Overexpression of AKT1 enhances tumor cell proliferation, growth, and suppression of apoptosis and overexpression of AKT2 increases tumor migration, invasion, and metastasis. Hence inhibiting these isoforms is an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of breast cancer. The safety and efficacy of ATP-competitive and allosteric AKT inhibitors are currently under investigation in clinical trials. However, the expected clinical efficacy has not been achieved. Since the ATP binding domain is conserved among different protein kinase families, the ATP competitive drug candidates bind non-specifically and show side effects. To overcome the challenge of “non-specificity”, direct mRNA targeting is a favorable alternative. This target specificity can be achieved using antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) which are a new class of drugs that bind to the complementary mRNA and alter protein expression. The improvements in the chemical structure of ASO and the aid of conjugate delivery system has resulted in successful clinical translation of several antisense drugs.  However, currently there are no FDA approved antisense drugs for cancer therapy suggesting the need to direct efforts in the oncology domain. We optimized an ASO design to target the AKT mRNA and inhibit translation of AKT proteins for breast cancer therapy. Our ASO design contains chemical modifications like Phosphorothioate (PS) at alternate positions throughout the sequence and 2’-O-methyl (2’-O-Me) modifications at the terminal three positions on both ends for improved in vivo activity. Phosphorothioate are DNA analogs that exhibit nuclease stability and improved in vivo circulation. The 2’-O-Me provides additional exonuclease stability and increases the binding affinity of the ASO to the target mRNA. This gapmer design of PS and 2’-O-Me support RNase H cleavage of mRNA target. The pH low insertion peptide (pHLIP) undergoes membrane insertion on sensing the tumor cell surface acidity and has been used for the delivery of ASOs and small molecule anticancer drugs specifically to the tumor cells. Hence in this multi-disciplinary project, we are evaluating pHLIP conjugated PS-2’-O-Me AKT inhibitors to inhibit the translation of AKT mRNA as a clinically translatable strategy for the treatment of breast cancer. The two aims making up the project are 1) Develop chemically modified pHLIP- AKT inhibitor conjugates to target AKT1 and AKT2 mRNA, 2) Test the in vivo efficacy of pHLIP- AKT inhibitor conjugates in xenograft mouse models. Overall, our studies will enable the use of pHLIP- AKT inhibitors as a novel therapeutic strategy for targeting AKT and if successful could potentially lead to a new therapy for breast cancer, improve patient care and influence pharmacy practice."
1102 Title: Heplisav-B Efficacy in Selected Patient Populations,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Background:

Certain patient populations are at greater risk for severe morbidity and mortality from infection with the hepatitis B virus. This includes individuals with cirrhosis, those who have failed to seroconvert after previous hepatitis B vaccinations, and immunocompromised individuals following liver or kidney transplants. Currently, there is limited data available from the manufacturer regarding the efficacy of the Heplisav-B vaccine in these patient populations. The University of Arkansas Medical Science P&T committee approved Heplisav-B on April 26th, 2022.

1282 Growth and Financial Outcomes of a Remote Physiologic Monitoring Service for Hypertension in the Primary Care Setting,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to describe the creation and growth through two phases of a remote physiologic monitoring (RPM) service for hypertension in primary care. The secondary objectives are to determine 1) the average monetary charge submitted and 2) the average reimbursement received per patient enrolled in Phase 1 and Phase 2.

In the United States, nearly half of adults (48.1%) have a diagnosis of hypertension, or are taking medication for hypertension. Hypertension management remains to be a significant challenge with several potential contributing factors, including lack of routine blood pressure monitoring and limited access to healthcare. Traditionally, hypertension management has relied upon in-office visits with primary care physicians to monitor blood pressure and adjust antihypertensive medications. Primary care physicians are often tasked with managing various complex conditions within a limited visit duration, which may require more pressing patient needs to be prioritized over assessing blood pressure control. Additionally, blood pressure control may not be achieved in a timely manner due to delays between follow-up visits. Remote physiologic monitoring (RPM) involves collecting and analyzing patient physiologic data that is used to manage treatment of chronic or acute health conditions. This allows patients to monitor physiologic parameters remotely and providers to use this data to assess condition control and modify treatment plans as indicated. RPM presents a promising solution to address the challenge of hypertension management by allowing for monitoring of patients’ blood pressure outside of the traditional clinic setting.

In an effort to improve blood pressure control and increase access to care, a pharmacist-run RPM service for hypertension was developed and implemented in a network of patient-centered medical homes at a large academic medical center."

Secondary outcomes include total number of RSV vaccines administered, percent of patients who attended an educational session and received the RSV vaccine at a vaccination event and the impact of an educational session on patient knowledge of RSV and the RSV vaccine.

RSV is a significant cause of respiratory illness in infants, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals, often leading to hospitalizations and complications. According to the West Virginia Department of Health, chronic lower respiratory disease was the 5th leading cause of death in West Virginia in 2021. However, according to Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only around 24% of all adults 60 years of age and older in the United States received an RSV vaccine during the 2023-24 season. Many campaigns are underway to increase the percentage of older adults who have received this vaccine. This project aims to assess whether a RSV educational session presented by pharmacists followed by a vaccination event within two to four weeks is an effective tool to increase vaccination rates."

Bempedoic acid, available as an oral, single-agent or in a fixed-dose combination with ezetimibe, was first approved in 2020 to lower density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as an add-on other lipid-lowering agent. The agent later expanded its indication to include reduction in myocardial infarction or cardiovascular revascularization among individuals with established or at high-risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Bemepdoic acid holds promise as a novel strategy of CVD risk reduction given that many patients are unable to tolerate statins due to adverse events, such as myalgias. While the mechanism of bempedoic acid minimizes the risk of myalgias, different adverse events, such as increased uric acid or development of gout, emerged within randomized controlled trials."

1030 Targeting Rho GTPases RAC1 and CDC42 in Advanced Prostate Cancer Cells,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Standard treatment for advanced prostate cancer targets the AR using androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Despite initial responses, patients eventually progress to androgen-independent disease with metastasis, raising the need for novel treatment options. GTPases regulate many metastasis-associated processes, including cell division, cell growth, cell migration, and cell adhesion. Novel inhibitors for GTPases are currently being evaluated for efficacy in metastatic breast cancer. However, little is known about their utility for metastatic prostate cancer. We hypothesize that Rho GTPase inhibitor efficacy will vary between prostate cancer cell models based on AR expression status and metastatic potential. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of nine compounds designed to inhibit the GTPase pathway in the setting of androgen receptor-positive compared to the negative receptor counterpart."
1063 Simulated Live Interpreter-Patient Encounters: Impact on Pharmacy Students� Communication Skills and Confidence,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to measure students’ self-assessed skills and confidence in employing best practices for communication through an interpreter. Secondary objectives include measuring students’ perception of the value of the activity and comparing students’ self-assessment of their skills relative to the activity facilitators’ assessment. The 2025 Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) Accreditation Standards for pharmacy education require students to recognize and mitigate cultural and structural barriers to improve access to care. Combined with the ability to communicate effectively, a primary way to overcome the systemic barriers are to use language interpreter services for those with limited English proficiency. Education of pharmacy students on the use of interpreter services has limited literature, specifically in the setting of a simulation activity."
1090 Impact of Cross-Trained Community Health Worker (CHW) Pharmacy Technicians on Pneumococcal Vaccine Hesitancy and Vaccination Gap Closures,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Vaccinations are among the most cost-effective medical interventions, yet immunizations rates are below national targets.  Community Pharmacy Enhanced Services Network Missouri (CPESN MO) implemented a Pharmacy Vaccine Gap Closure Program with the Department of Health and Senior Services that addressed vaccine gaps. The program was designed on the current procedural terminology (CPT) code G0310 (immunization counseling done by a physician or other qualified healthcare professional when vaccine(s) are not administered on the same date of service) with service-based reimbursed consistent with physician fee schedules. During the intervention, CHWs documented demographic information, health-related social needs, existing health conditions, current immunization eligibility, and gap closures. This study is a sub-group analysis on pneumococcal vaccine hesitancy interventions within the CPESN MO Pharmacy Vaccine Gap Closure Program within the first six months (January 2024 – June 2024). A paucity of literature exists describing the impact of CHWs located in pharmacies on vaccine gap closures. The primary objective of this descriptive study is to evaluate the impact of pharmacy-based cross-trained CHWs/pharmacy technicians on pneumococcal vaccine hesitancy and vaccination gap closures. The secondary objective is to assess the program’s impact on common healthcare barriers including, but not limited to, health conditions, social determinants of health and cost-effectiveness."
1118 Impact of Pharmacist-Led Interventions on Medication Adherence in Patients with Hypertension at a Federally Qualified Health Center,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to examine patients’ self-reported adherence to antihypertensive medications in a pharmacist-led cohort (intervention) compared to those receiving the standard of care (control) in a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC). The secondary objectives are to evaluate antihypertensive medication adherence based on medication possession ratio (MPR) and to compare self-reported adherence to the MPR while managed in the intervention versus control arms. 

Previous studies involving pharmacist-led home blood pressure (BP) monitoring programs have demonstrated improvements in BP control. However, the applicability of previous studies to an FQHC is limited and often omits patients with certain risk enhancing conditions. Project HOPE is a randomized controlled crossover trial, which was initiated to provide ambulatory blood pressure cuffs to patients with resistant hypertension or hypertension with a pre-determined risk enhancing condition. Patients were enrolled in the study based on a diagnosis of hypertension in the last five years with at least two visits to the health center within the previous 12 months (November 2021- November 2022) with at least two documented in office blood pressure readings > 140/90 plus an additional pre-determined risk factor or resistant hypertension (rHTN). The risk factors include chronic kidney disease and congestive heart failure with additional disease comorbidities later added to the protocol including cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, acute myocardial infarction, unspecified, and old myocardial infarction.  

The purpose of this retrospective chart review is to examine the impact of pharmacist-led interventions on adherence to BP medications compared to those receiving the standard of care in an FQHC."
1121 Mind the Statin Gap � Evaluating Barriers in Pharmacist-Recommended Statin Therapy,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective is to identify barriers associated with pharmacist-recommended statin therapy in patients with diabetes. The secondary objectives are to measure the change in success rates of pharmacy-recommended statin therapies prior to and after pharmacist-led education sessions, measure the change in patient knowledge regarding statin therapy prior to and after pharmacist-led education sessions, and identify the types of interventions performed by pharmacists during patient education.

Cardiovascular disease has been a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Americans and one of our nation’s costliest chronic diseases for decades. In 2011, it was projected by the American Heart Association (AHA) that about 40% of the United States population will have some form of cardiovascular disease by 2030. However, that percentage was reached back in 2015, 15 years sooner than anticipated. According to the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines, statin therapy is recommended in individuals 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes and LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL without clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Moreover, one of the objectives set by Healthy People 2030 is to “increase the treatment of blood cholesterol among eligible adults” by ensuring high risk patients are taking statins to reduce rates of cardiovascular disease. As of 2020, the most recent data of eligible patients receiving statin therapy is 41.8%. By 2030, this initiative by the Department of Health and Human Services is aiming to achieve 55% of eligible adults on statin therapy. Despite strong evidence supporting the use of statin in the diabetic population, there is a significant gap that exists in its implementation, resulting in suboptimal clinical outcomes. Enhancing pharmacy-recommended statin therapies has the potential to close this gap."

Previous studies have shown that LLPM helps reinforce clinical knowledge and improve learner confidence but the impacts of LLPM in the context of Transition of Care (TOC) have yet to be studied. This study aims to address this gap by investigating how participation in LLPM in a 6-week TOC rotation impacts the development of clinical reasoning and communication skills among pharmacy learners during their APPE rotations."
1376 Does Spironolactone Reduce Atrial Fibrillation from Cardiac Surgery? An Observational Cohort Study,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This study aims to compare the efficacy of spironolactone vs the standard of care, beta-adrenergic blockers, for reducing the incidence of perioperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) after a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) at 30 days post-CABG. 
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and has increased by more than 3-fold over the past 50 years, currently affecting 3 to 6 million people in the United States. Perioperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a common complication in patients undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), a cardiac surgery done to improve blood flow to the heart, with a reported incidence of 21% to 34% post-surgery. POAF is associated with significantly higher rates of both short-term and long-term mortality, increased hospital stays, and increased expenditures for patients and healthcare systems. Current prevention strategies are suboptimal necessitating the need for further research to establish new and potentially more effective prevention methods. 
Aldosterone is a profibrotic hormone that is found to be elevated in patients with AF. Elevated aldosterone levels occur before, during, and after cardiac surgery, with levels being higher in patients who develop POAF. This suggests that aldosterone may be a risk factor for POAF occurrence. 
Spironolactone, a common mineralocorticoid antagonist, prevents aldosterone-mediated cardiac remodeling in patients with heart failure and reduces the incidence of AF in this population.  This suggests that spironolactone may have some efficacy in reducing POAF after CABG."

1406 What�s a Pharmacist: Enhancing Childrens� Awareness through Interactive Outreach at a Public Science Center,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Pharmacy has a public relations problem. To most children, pharmacist is either an unknown word or simply a person that sells drugs. Even the perceptions of many adults have not kept up with advancements in pharmacists’ scope of practice. Embedded within a nonprofit science museum, our lab aims to educate the public, especially children, about how pharmacists care for their patients and communities. To accomplish this aim, we have developed a series of short interactive activities that allow museum guests to play the role of a pharmacist or a patient seeking care. Participants can race to compound a drug, use their memory to catch prescription errors, or seek help with medication scheduling after struggling to keep track of unsorted medications. Since launching this initiative in April 2024, we have interacted with over 3000 museum guests. Those participants walk away better able to appreciate the essential role that pharmacists play in healthcare and, in the case of children, newly informed to consider pharmacy as a career."

As a result, fentanyl overdose has become a critical public health concern. Fentanyl test strips (FTS) represent an effective harm reduction strategy, aimed at mitigating the rising number of fentanyl-related overdoses. By allowing individuals to test drugs for the presence of fentanyl before use, FTS can play a crucial role in preventing accidental overdoses. The purpose of this study is to analyze the general public's perceived benefits and barriers to the use of FTS, and differences in perceptions across rural and urban settings. This will provide valuable insights into the potential for broader FTS implementation and identify areas for future educational interventions."

1311 Practical Naloxone Communication Tips for Pharmacists: Lessons Learned from The Linguistic Model of Patient Participation in Care,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Background: Opioid overdose remains a significant public health challenge in rural areas of the United States. Expanding access to naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is a key evidence-based strategy in reducing overdose-related deaths. Community pharmacists, given their accessibility and frequent patient interactions, are well-positioned to offer and dispense naloxone, and conversations about naloxone may increase now that it is available as an over-the-counter product. However, pharmacists often face communication barriers, such as stigma and concerns of offending the patients, which hinder effective naloxone conversations. We used a theoretical framework, the Linguistic Model of Patient Participation in Care (LM), to explore the communication preferences of rural patients as a crucial step in preparing pharmacists to have patient-centered discussions about naloxone.

Objective: This study aimed to explore rural pharmacists’ and patients’ communication preferences related to naloxone conversations."

Vaccinations are one of the most cost-effective medical interventions, yet healthcare providers struggle to effectively communicate with patients their importance and ensure vaccine access and education, particularly in at-risk communities. Community Pharmacy Enhanced Services Network Missouri (CPESN MO) designed and implemented a Pharmacy Vaccine Gap Closure Program that addressed vaccine hesitancy and vaccination gap closures from January 2024 through July 2024, as a continuation of an HRSA-funded pilot. This program utilized cross-trained community health workers (CHW)/pharmacy technicians to deliver vaccine hesitancy education in community pharmacies. This led to increased vaccination rates and an enhanced understanding of vaccinations, based on CPT code G0310. As part of the interventions, all participants submitted a questionnaire that gathered demographic information, health-related social needs, existing health conditions, and current vaccination eligibility. This descriptive study focused on reviewing the collected information to determine the impact of the MO Gap program on RSV vaccine hesitancy and gap closures through sub-group analysis. It is necessary to determine if cross-trained CHW/pharmacy technicians interventions, such as the Pharmacy Vaccine Gap Closure Program, significantly impact RSV vaccination gap closure rates, particularly for vulnerable and at-risk populations.

Background: The role of CGMs in diabetes management is well established. The American Diabetes Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology both recommend that CGM devices be offered to people with diabetes. Considering that CGMs are increasingly available in the community, it is vital that pharmacy students be comfortable in recommending and counseling on these devices.  Schools/colleges of pharmacy considering the incorporation of a formal assessment of students on CGM counseling will thus need a validated rubric. Interim data from this study was presented at the 2024 AACP Annual meeting: Candelario, Danielle M. et al. American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education, Volume 88, Issue 9, 101075."
1087 Immunization Impasse: Uncovering the Reasons for Vaccine Fatigue,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Given that the risk of influenza has not decreased and there is evidence that the influenza vaccine is effective, the decline in flu vaccination rates requires further investigation. In order to understand how vaccine hesitancy and fatigue plays a role in a person’s influenza vaccination status, this study will collect information on influenza vaccine beliefs and behaviors. Previous researchers utilized elements from the 5C model of vaccine hesitancy when designing assessment questions. The five elements, which will be used in this survey, assess a person’s willingness to be vaccinated based on their confidence in the vaccine, complacency, constraints that may prevent vaccination, calculation, and collective responsibility to help others. Some of the questions used in this survey have been modified from an extensive questionnaire created by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE). Previous surveys have shown that vaccine fatigue is one reasons for vaccine hesitancy, but there is limited data on specific causes for the fatigue. This observational study aims to assess for possible reasons for influenza vaccine fatigue among adults and to determine if there are common factors that influence vaccine fatigue among people with similar demographic characteristics. ."

1005 Combination of Epigallocatechin 3 gallate and Ellagic acid Ameliorates Scopolamine-induced Memory Impairment in Mice,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) play an important role in attention, learning and memory [1]. Pharmacological blockade of the mAChRs using scopolamine imbalanced the cholinergic transmission in brain, increased activity of acetylcholinesterase enzymes (AChEs) and severely impaired the memory [2,3,4]. Therefore, inhibiting the AChEs enzyme, may prove a helpful strategy in alleviating the memory disorders [5]. Scopolamine-treated animal models are extensively used due to mimicking the behavioral and molecular features of neurocognitive disorders, like Alzheimer's disease [3,4,6]. Evidence showed that natural compounds can be the rational choice for treating scopolamine-induced memory disorder owing to inhibiting the AChEs, and increasing the level of acetylcholine, antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, and safer therapeutic properties [7.8]. In vitro studies showed that Ellagic acid, a dietary polyphenolic compound present in many fruits and nuts inhibit the several important sites of AChEs and ameliorated the memory deficits in scopolamine-injected rats [8]. Similarly, another compound Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a natural polyphenolic agent of green tea [9], improved scopolamine-induced memory impairment by forming a good docking-complex with AChE [7]. Since the neurodegenerative diseases are multifaceted, heterogeneous, and progressive, it suggests a need for combination treatments for powerful neuroprotection [9, 10]. Therefore, considering EA or EGCG alone to treat scopolamine-induced memory dysfunction in previous studies surely missed finding out more substantial neuroprotection. This study examined the combined effect of EGCG and EA for the very first time on scopolamine-induced mice, adopting behavioral paradigms, Novel Object Recognition (NOR) and Contextual Fear Conditioning (CFC)."

The goal is to use an active learning model to increase pharmacist comfort and readiness in HIV testing and prescribing medication prophylaxis.
According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), there were 31,800 new cases of HIV diagnosed in 2022 in the USA. Pharmacy-based HIV care is included in the Ending HIV Epidemic (EHE) goals for prevention of new infections. Previous research shows barriers to providing pharmacy-based HIV care in the community pharmacy setting include pharmacy laboratory test ordering, adjustments in workflow, education and pharmacy reimbursement. A study surveying pharmacist on perception and knowledge of HIV PrEP therapy concluded that educational materials would help to improve pharmacists’ confidence in talking with patients about side effects, medication adherence and recommendations for HIV medications. Pharmacist education is necessary for communicating these topics with patients without bias or judgement. Active learning has shown a significant impact in understanding and retention and short educational videos may provide enough context and information for this prescribing service. 
Pharmacists receive training prior to performing the HIV PEP and PrEP Service but additional training may help increase utilization of the service. This additional educational training was developed to enhance pharmacists readiness and comfortability in providing this service."

A sports pharmacist brings their clinical expertise in managing drug interactions, optimizing treatment protocols for conditions like pain, inflammation, concussions, exercise-induced asthma, depression/anxiety, and mental health issues, and providing guidance on supplements and performance-enhancing drugs. Pharmacists can leverage their medication knowledge and dosing expertise to address the unique treatment and preventive care needs of athletes.
Over the past 20 years, new roles for pharmacists in sports medicine have been explored, though none have been officially established. This evolving position represents a novel opportunity, becoming the first of its kind within a healthcare system. Currently, the only known U.S. sports pharmacist role is based at the University of Southern California's College of Pharmacy. Internationally, well-developed curricula and positions exist, mainly focusing on anti-doping and prohibited substances. However, incorporating this role into a health system allows sports pharmacists to broaden their scope beyond anti-doping, offering more comprehensive clinical services to support athletes.
In sports medicine and orthopedic clinics, where athletes and physically active patients recover from injuries, pharmacists can play a crucial role in managing pain, inflammation, and post-surgical recovery. Their expertise in pharmacotherapy, especially regarding pain management without reliance on potentially addictive medications, aligns with efforts to reduce opioid use and promote alternative treatments such as anti-inflammatory medications or muscle relaxants.
This study aims to explore the perspectives of an interprofessional healthcare team within a sports medicine practice regarding the impact and significance of a full-time clinical sports pharmacist."

1252 Barriers to Implementation of Pharmacist Prescribing of Oral Contraceptives in Arkansas Community Pharmacies,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"A 2021 Arkansas state law authorized licensed pharmacists to initiate oral contraceptive prescriptions due to a need for increased access to hormonal contraception among women. Since then, the state protocol has had limited adoption in community pharmacies in Arkansas.
There has been a growing need for increasing access to hormonal contraception among women as access to healthcare becomes a challenge for many. Pharmacists, noted as one of the most accessible healthcare providers, are strategically positioned in the community to help mitigate these issues by improving access to hormonal contraception. While this authorization represents a significant step towards improving public health, several barriers may hinder its ubiquitous implementation and may explain the limited adoption of this protocol across pharmacies in the state. Understanding these barriers is critical, as addressing them will enhance pharmacists’ ability to increase access to hormonal contraceptives, particularly in underserved areas. The objective of this study is to identify barriers to implementation of pharmacist prescribing of oral contraceptives in Arkansas community pharmacies."
"1110 Comparison of Antibiotic Prescribing for Urinary Tract Infections (UTI), Sinusitis, Group A Streptococcal Pharyngitis, and Pyelonephritis by Prescribe",2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Introduction: Currently, 25%-40% of all outpatient visits are with physician's assistants (PAs) or nurse practitioners (NPs)1. PAs and NPs receive less formal education on diagnosis and pharmacology than physicians. The goal of this study was to determine if there is a difference in prescribing patterns between physicians and PAs/NPs for selected infectious diseases. 
Design: This was a cross-sectional study utilizing the CHARM (Collaboration to Harmonize Antimicrobial Registry Measures) database. 
Methods: The CHARM database is a Michigan multi-system registry containing archival data previously collected from the medical records of partnering health systems regarding outpatient antibiotic prescribing. This project evaluated antibiotic prescribing data from July 2021 to June 2023 available through CHARM. Antibiotic prescriptions were identified and associated with ICD-10 codes for acute sinusitis, chronic sinusitis, group A streptococcal pharyngitis, UTI, and pyelonephritis. Guideline concordance between prescriber types was compared using chi-square tests.
Results: 137,960 prescriptions were included in the study. Of those, 63.7% were written by PAs and NPs, and 36.3% were written by physicians. Compared to physicians, PAs and NPs, prescribed concordant antibiotics more often for acute sinusitis, chronic sinusitis, group A streptococcal pharyngitis, and pyelonephritis (P <0.01). There was no significant difference between groups for uncomplicated UTIs (P= 0.10). 
Conclusion: Our data suggests PAs and NPs prescribe antibiotics at a higher rate of guideline concordance than physicians."
1169 An Evaluation of a Pharmacist Led Chronic Condition Management Telehealth Program on Clinical Outcomes for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of a pharmacist-led telehealth diabetes management program on clinical outcomes compared to traditional care alone across a 12-month period. Employees and dependents of a self-insured manufacturer who are diagnosed with diabetes are offered access to a Chronic Condition Management (CCM) Program delivered by clinical pharmacists. The program offers appointments via telehealth or in-person as a supplement to their primary care provider visits. Patients of the CCM program are located throughout the United States and primarily utilize clinical pharmacy CCM services via telehealth to aid in diabetes management.  

There are a few studies on the impact of pharmacist led CCM programs, and they have shown that pharmacists can improve clinical outcomes for patients. Maxwell et al. (2016) reports that veterans included in their study had a statistically significant reduction in A1c from baseline in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. Results showed that of the patients who complied with their scheduled visits, 38% were able to meet the ADA recommended A1c goal. Of the patients included, 15.4% were able to meet the combined ADA goals for A1c, SBP, DBP, and LDL-C.  

The idea of a pharmacist led CCM program delivered via telehealth improving clinical outcomes related to diabetes as compared to visits with a traditional provider alone warrants further investigation. This study will help determine if additional and comprehensive visits with a clinical pharmacist will improve patient diabetes clinical outcomes, adherence, and utilization of guideline directed therapy."
1298 Nebraska Pharmacists� Perceptions of Pharmacy Technician Role Expansion,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study is to describe the perspectives of Nebraska pharmacists regarding pharmacy technician role expansion. It is well-recognized that time and workload are significant barriers to the daily responsibilities of pharmacists. These barriers are exacerbated by the increasing desire of many pharmacies to expand the clinical services that are provided to patients, and environmental factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic impacting staffing and increasing burnout. One strategy that has been proposed to expand services is through increasing the roles and responsibilities of pharmacy technicians. The literature has found that pharmacy technicians who administer vaccines can reduce pharmacist workload and that pharmacy technicians may have comparable (or even higher) rates of accuracy when performing final prescription verification compared to pharmacists. Pharmacy technician role expansion can also provide more opportunities for career development and potentially increase the attractiveness of the role and retention for current technicians. Despite these potential benefits, there is limited evidence about how pharmacists’ view pharmacy technician role expansion and how this might differ across various practice settings."

A survey in 2021 reported technician turnover rates of 21% to 31% across the pharmacy industry, with 1 out of 10 pharmacy leaders reporting over 40% turnover despite expressed job satisfaction. Pharmacist leadership behaviors have been previously correlated with organizational commitment and turnover intention. In previous literature by Rosenthal, a correlation between cultural factors and personality traits of hospital pharmacists found greater value in team-orientated pharmacists that prioritized conscientiousness. Conscientiousness includes behaviors such as the ability to control impulses and the prioritization of tasks. 
The aim of this research study is to gain insight on the correlation between leadership behaviors to the retention and resilience of pharmacy associates. The sparse literature pertaining to this subject measured commitment and turnover intention from observed leadership behaviors. There were specific pharmacy leadership behaviors that were established, but there was not a correlation to the impact these behaviors had on employee outcomes. This study evaluates the correlation between actual turnover data and a self-administered Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality test taken by pharmacy leaders with a primary purpose to create more effective relationships within the community pharmacy."

Uncovering Care Gaps: Parent Perspectives on Gaps in Type 1 Diabetes Management for Children Aged 8-12 Years in Kentucky and Southern Indiana,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic autoimmune condition resulting from the destruction of pancreatic beta cells, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. T1DM affects approximately 1.6 million people in the United States, including 200,000 children and adolescents. Proper management is crucial to prevent complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease, which become more likely when blood glucose is not carefully monitored from an early age. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) emphasizes individualized and comprehensive care tailored to the developmental needs of the child to prevent long-term health complications. 
While many studies focus on the biological and psychosocial aspects of T1DM management, fewer have examined how various environmental factors influence care. This research addresses that gap by applying Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory, which examines multiple layers of environmental influences—from immediate family interactions to broader societal factors—on diabetes management. Specifically, the objective of this study is to explore parent perceptions of these influences and identify gaps in care for children aged 8-12 years in Kentucky and Southern Indiana. The goal is to provide region-specific insights and inform tailored interventions."
1010 Evaluation of chronic hepatitis C virus treatment outcomes using a family medicine interdisciplinary treatment team,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study is to assess chronic hepatitis C virus (CHC) treatment success rate in those utilizing a family medicine interdisciplinary team. Treatment of CHC within primary care is growing, but there are many barriers that can delay or prevent patients from receiving treatment. One family medicine office established an interdisciplinary team, consisting of a physician champion, an ambulatory care clinical pharmacist, and a licensed practical nurse (LPN), to mitigate delays between time of diagnosis and treatment completion. Once a physician determined an appropriate candidate for CHC treatment, the patient was referred to the clinical pharmacist for assessment of drug interactions, assistance with prior authorization concerns, and scheduled for four-week follow-up appointments during treatment to assess for medication adherence and adverse effects. The LPN ensured prior authorization approval from insurance. This study assesses the impact made by the interdisciplinary care team on CHC treatment success. Additional secondary outcomes seek to identify barriers to receiving treatment as well as comparing the treatment success of those utilizing the interdisciplinary care team with those that did not."

This project’s goal is to assess the effect of discontinuation of a GLP-1 Receptor Agonist on weight. According to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States has a prevalence of obesity higher than 20%. Obesity can increase morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular disease which is the leading cause of death in the United States. Per the CDC, obesity costs the United States Healthcare system almost $173 billion per year. 

Confounding variables that can affect weight changes include diet, physical activity, environmental factors, comorbidities, medications, and emotional factors. This research is being conducted at a federally qualified health center, therefore, environmental factors such as access to healthy foods and safe areas for physical activity should be considered. Comorbidities that can impact weight include obstructive sleep apnea, Cushing syndrome, depression, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Medications that can induce weight gain include sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, insulin, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants.

The secondary objective is to identify external factors that may influence their intention to counsel. There are multiple drug classes with unwanted genitourinary adverse effects (GAE); for example, mineralocorticoid receptor agonists could cause gynecomastia, and a potential adverse effect of serotonin reuptake inhibitors is sexual dysfunction. Sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), a new drug class, has an increased prevalence of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Therefore, it is important to counsel on adverse effects, especially in regards to unwanted GAE. Despite the critical role of pharmacists in patient education, prior research indicates a lack of emphasis regarding counseling on GAE, which can significantly impact patient adherence and outcomes. This study hopes to further evaluate the factors impacting the provision of patient education."

Equity gaps exist regarding childhood vaccination rates. To address these equity gaps, the federally run VFC Program coordinates with public agencies to recruit and retain a network of VFC Program providers. This allows them to receive publicly purchased vaccines and provide these vaccines to children whose parents or guardians may not be able to afford them. In MD, pharmacists may serve as healthcare providers to vaccinate children seven years or older for routine vaccinations recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Council on Immunization Practices (ACIP). To assist in addressing equity gaps, pharmacists in the community setting may benefit from participation in the VFC Program. Minimal literature exists on best practices for successfully implementing the components of VFC Program in this setting. However, community collaboration and engagement with local school networks have shown positive contributions toward decreasing vaccine hesitancy and uptake, and forging community partnerships may prove helpful in establishing the pharmacist role within the VFC Program. Therefore, a best practice document will help identify challenges and the best methods for establishing a VFC Program site within the community pharmacy setting."

1336 Removing Barriers to Medication Access by Providing Free Uber Rides to a Charitable Pharmacy,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The purpose of this study is to determine the impact on patient medication adherence rates when free rides are provided to patients from a charitable pharmacy through UberHealth and Sostento partnership. The site of this study is a charitable pharmacy in southwestern Ohio that serves patients who are uninsured and under-insured who cannot afford their medications. This pharmacy also offers in-house primary care services, medication review appointments, and screenings for medical conditions at no cost to patients. While the pharmacy has eliminated cost as a barrier to adherence, 27% of the pharmacy’s patients reported transportation as a barrier to accessing pharmacy services in the 2024 annual patient survey. This echoes a national trend in which 3.6 million Americans delay or forgo medical care due to transportation barriers each year. Existing literature identifies transportation to medical appointments as an issue with a few completed studies determining solutions. Data is lacking regarding the impact transportation barriers have on accessing pharmacy services. According to the literature, prescription delivery is an alternative that many pharmacies have adopted but is too costly for a non-profit charitable pharmacy that serves patients who cannot afford delivery fees. To combat transportation barriers, three companies, two non-profits (Sostento, the charitable pharmacy) and one for-profit (Uber) partnered to provide free rides to 115 patients through a pilot program from 10/1/23 to 9/30/24. The rideshare program consists of a system that starts with patients indicating the need for a ride to the pharmacy. Staff members then coordinate a scheduled or immediate Uber pick-up from the patient’s origin point to the pharmacy. Return rides are also provided if requested. Patients do not need a smartphone, credit card, or Uber account to participate in the program. There was also no restriction on the distance traveled.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), defined by the lack of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptors, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, is one of more aggressive breast cancers with therapy guidelines that vary every year and among different regions. Currently, treatment regiments utilize chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. However, with a wide range of therapeutic options for TNBC, optimized standard of care still remains unclear. In this investigation, treatment data from key regions, such as the United States, Europe, and Japan will be analyzed to assess the correlation between patient outcomes, defined by clinical trial data, and current treatment guidelines by examining current prescribing patterns. Cost of therapy coupled with regional regulatory approvals impact patient accessibility, which will also be assessed."
1354 Scan and Deliver: Barcode Medication Administration Impact on Patient Care,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this quality improvement project is to remove barriers to barcode medication administration (BCMA) to reduce risks to patient safety and improve billing and 340B compliance. BCMA has been shown to reduce medication errors and improve patient safety. While this is well known, a lesser-known benefit to BCMA compliance is billing and 340B compliance. BCMA ensures that the correct product is being billed when it is dispensed or administered to patients. When a product is incorrectly billed, it can result in rejections by payors and inaccurate 340B credit accumulation. Non-compliance with 340B program regulations can result in termination of the program for a health system, which increases healthcare costs for patients. Thus, to prevent financial barriers to patients, BCMA compliance is a necessity."

In the United States, approximately 60% of women will experience at least one UTI in their lifetimes. Additionally, 20-40% of women who have experienced at least one previous UTI are likely to experience another one, and 25-50% will go on to experience multiple recurrent infections. Furthermore, the evaluation and treatment of UTIs cost approximately $2 billion annually in the United States. Urinary tract infections are a highly prevalent disease state with a high economic burden. Prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy is recommended for resolution of symptoms and clinical cure as soon as the patient becomes symptomatic. Pharmacists are easily accessible practitioners that may be able to bridge a gap in women’s healthcare by providing UTI management in community-based retail pharmacies. In Delaware, a pharmacist may order, test, screen, and treat for a variety of health conditions including: influenza, group A streptococcus pharyngitis, SARS-COV-2 or other respiratory illness, condition, or disease, lice, skin conditions, including ringworm and athlete’s foot, and other emerging and existing public health threats identified by the Division of Public Health if permitted by an order, rule, or regulation. An important observation that UTI “test and treat” did not make it into this list but was mentioned in one of the law’s revisions means that there is some, yet not enough, evidence supporting community pharmacy-based UTI management. This research will assess patient interest in utilizing community pharmacies for UTI management, and patient interest may be interpreted/applied to support or refute legislative change in Delaware."
1153 Public Knowledge and Intentions Regarding Fentanyl Test Strips (FTS): A National Cross-Sectional Survey,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The purpose of this study is to assess the knowledge and utilization intentions surrounding fentanyl test strips (FTS) in the United States (U.S.) general public. Illicit drug supply contamination with fentanyl is believed to be a major contributor to national overdose mortality rates. Drug checking technologies, such as FTS, have been created to reduce the incidents of unintentional consumption of illicit fentanyl and employed as a harm reduction measure to reduce the rate of overdose among drug users. Research has shown awareness and acceptance of FTS in drug users and healthcare providers. However, literature is lacking in exploring the knowledge and willingness/intention to use FTS in the U.S. general public. This study seeks to fill this gap."
1131 Vasopressor Medication Use Evaluation: Vasopressor Use Through Peripheral Line After Policy Initiation,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This medication use evaluation aims to assess the administration of vasopressors following the implementation of a hospital-wide policy on the proper use of vasoactive medications via peripheral intravenous (PIV) access. Vasoactive medications are critical for treating hemodynamic instability in critically ill patients, and timely initiation should not be delayed due to the unavailability of central venous access. Peripheral vasopressor administration is often avoided to prevent adverse events such as local tissue ischemia secondary to the class’s vasoconstrictive properties. Literature has demonstrated the need for maximum infusion rate of vasopressors, but there is no clear consensus on what that maximum rate should be. In April 2024, Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center (OLOL RMC) initiated a policy based on available literature in order to help guide health care providers on the safe and effective use of vasopressors through PIV access. The main objective of this medication use evaluation is to assess the adherence to the new administration of vasopressors hospital policy implemented earlier this year."
1240 An Evaluation of the Effects of a Specialty Pharmacist Embedded into a Specialty Disease State Clinic on Patient Access and Outcomes,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective is to increase the number of patients who initiate specialty drug therapy among those who are prescribed. Secondary endpoints include the time from the initial prescribing date to prior authorization approval, time to fill and initiation from the initial prescribing date, and adherence. Specialty pharmacies are invaluable as they improve patient outcomes, medication access, and patient and provider satisfaction. Medication access is one of the most significant social barriers that can strike some residents of Washington, D.C. A community-based specialty pharmacist will establish a partnership with the dermatology clinic where the pharmacy resident will help streamline specialty medication prescriptions to the pharmacy within the health system to increase patient access to specialty medications. The purpose of the embedded pharmacist would be to eliminate any barriers that may result in poor patient outcomes."
"1094 Impact of Pharmacy-Based, Cross-Trained Community Health Workers (CHW)/Pharmacy Technicians on COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy and Gap Closures",2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"COVID-19 immunization rates are below national and regional targets despite being one of the most cost-effective medical interventions. Data from a Health Resource & Services Administration funded project showed the impact of pharmacy-based CHWs in COVID-19 vaccine gap closures. The Community Pharmacy Enhanced Services Network Missouri (CPESN MO) implemented a Pharmacy Vaccine Gap Closure Program, based on this earlier study, in collaboration with the Department of Health and Senior Services to evaluate a state-wide impact of CHWs on vaccine gap closures. This program was based on the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code G0310 (immunization counseling by a physician or other qualified health care professional) and utilized cross-trained CHWs/pharmacy technicians to deliver vaccine hesitancy education in community pharmacies. Pharmacies were paid for the intervention based on a physician fee schedule rate on CPT 0310. During patient interventions, CHWs documented demographic information, health-related social needs, existing health conditions, current vaccination eligibility, and vaccine gap closures. This descriptive study is a subgroup analysis of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy interventions performed in CPESN MO’s Pharmacy Vaccine Gap Closure Program. Interventions occurred during the first six months of the program from January 2024 to June 2024.The primary objective of this descriptive study is to evaluate the impact of pharmacy-based, cross-trained CHWs/pharmacy technicians on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and gap closures. The secondary objective is to assess the program’s impact on common healthcare barriers including, but not limited to, health conditions, social determinants of health, and cost-effectiveness."
1084 Exploring the impact of Patient Trust in Community Pharmacists on Vaccination Decision-Making Preferences During Shared Clinical Decision-Making,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Pharmacists are recognized as one of the immunization providers responsible for implementing the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' shared clinical decision-making (SCDM) recommendations for certain vaccines, such as meningococcal B. SCDM recommendations emphasize collaborative discussions between patients and their providers, leading to decision-making about vaccinations. Trust has been suggested to affect healthcare-related decision-making preference, however the exact nature of this relationship—especially concerning vaccination and pharmacists—has yet to be investigated. Therefore, this study aims to assess the structural relationship between patients' trust in community pharmacists and their preferences for who should make vaccination decisions during SCDM, and how patients’ willingness to engage with pharmacists mediates this relationship."
1261 Determining the Perceptions and Awareness of Pharmacy as a Profession in Undergraduate Students,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to determine how undergraduate students perceive the profession of pharmacy and determine which factors impact undergraduate students’ perception of the profession of pharmacy. Despite an increase in the number of Doctor of Pharmacy programs, trends in enrollment indicate a declining interest in pharmacy as a career. Trends indicate a total of 109,150 applications were submitted to the colleges of pharmacy in 2009, and in 2019 that number was down to 40,292. Most recently the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy indicated that first professional student pharmacist enrollments, in all professional years, compared to 2022 were down 3 percent. If there is a gap in the perception of the profession, this could be a factor contributing to fewer applicants and interest in the profession. The pharmacy profession needs to distinguish itself from other healthcare professions by emphasizing the opportunities provided by the career. Identifying the current perceptions of the pharmacy profession by undergraduate students can contribute to improving recruitment. A clear understanding of the opportunities within the profession is essential early in the recruiting process to address the broad range of career opportunities within the profession."
1364 Are In-patient Hospital Pharmacy Work System Characteristics Associated with Work and Work-Life Outcomes?: A National Study,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The aims of this study were to explore the association of work system characteristics and pharmacists’ perceptions of patient medication safety and work-life outcomes among pharmacists practicing in in-patient hospital settings. 

Patient care and medication safety are improved in hospitals when pharmacists perform patient-centered clinical roles. However, pharmacists in hospital settings have more negative perceptions of their workplace compared to those in other settings, which is attributed mainly to their working conditions. In a hospital setting, up to 70% of pharmacists report experiencing moderate to high levels of burnout, raising the alarm that this may adversely impact patient safety. The association between hospital work system characteristics and pharmacists' evaluations of patient medication safety and their work life is not well understood. Previous studies often lack a comprehensive framework for systematically analyzing this relationship."
Scan and Deliver: Barcode Medication Administration Impact on Patient Care,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this quality improvement project is to remove barriers to barcode medication administration (BCMA) to reduce risks to patient safety and improve billing and 340B compliance. BCMA has been shown to reduce medication errors and improve patient safety. While this is well known, a lesser-known benefit to BCMA compliance is billing and 340B compliance. BCMA ensures that the correct product is being billed when it is dispensed or administered to patients. When a product is incorrectly billed, it can result in rejections by payors and inaccurate 340B credit accumulation. Non-compliance with 340B program regulations can result in termination of the program for a health system, which increases healthcare costs for patients. Thus, to prevent financial barriers to patients, BCMA compliance is a necessity."
1212 Pharmacist-Led Tobacco Cessation in Patients Undergoing Treatment for Substance Use Disorder,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect a pharmacist-led tobacco cessation program has on successful tobacco cessation attempts in patients undergoing concurrent substance use disorder treatment. Substance use disorder (SUD) and tobacco use are two common disease states that often occur together. Smoking prevalence among those using alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drugs is much higher than the prevalence of tobacco use among the general United States population. Patients with SUD and/or mental health disorders are more likely to die from tobacco-related causes before 60 years of age when compared with the general population. SUD patients that continue to smoke or begin to smoke are also more likely to experience SUD relapse. By providing tobacco cessation, the patient’s secondary addiction would be treated while also helping to improve their chances at sustained sobriety. While both medication assistance therapy (MAT) and tobacco cessation recommendations are currently offered, these services are not currently utilized together. There is data to support both pharmacist-led tobacco cessation services and the benefit and efficacy of tobacco cessation in patients with SUD. However, there has not been data that shows the benefits of a pharmacist-led tobacco cessation service for patients with SUD. These patients are using medication to help with their SUD, and adding medication for tobacco cessation may seem daunting, yet pharmacists are well equipped to make these recommendations for additional drug therapy."
1111 Effectiveness of Single Tablet Regimen Within or Between Class Switches in Maintaining or Achieving Viral Suppression in People Living With HIV,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"HIV antiretroviral therapy regimens are simplifying to effective single tablet regimens (STRs). Current guidelines prefer the use of an integrase inhibitor (INSTI) as the base drug when switching therapy. However, there is limited data that compares the efficacy of base drug class switching types to one another, only individual agents. This study is a retrospective, cohort design reviewing the Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) Pharmacy Patient Management Program (PMP) for outreached patients that have been prescribed a single tablet HIV regimen for second line therapy. The objective of the study is to identify which STR base drug class switch will result in the greatest amount of undetectable PLWH. The outcome assessed will be the percentage of each STR base drug class switch with an undetectable viral load after the first follow up."
1001 Adherence Rates and Health Outcomes for Individual Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy with SUD and without SUD,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and substance use disorder (SUD) are both critical conditions that require consistent medication adherence to improve quality of life. Interruption in therapy could adversely affect both disease states, potentially increasing susceptibility to infection in HIV and relapse symptoms in SUD. Given the need for adherence in both conditions, it is important to investigate whether having HIV alone, versus both HIV and SUD, influences medication adherence. Previous studies completed in different areas of the world have shown that patients with both HIV and SUD may demonstrate higher adherence to specific medications compared to those with HIV alone. However, these studies were conducted in outpatient opioid treatment clinics where patients might have received additional support. MSDH pharmacy is not an outpatient opioid clinic, but we do provide MTM services for the opioid patients. The objective of this study is to identify whether adherence rates, viral load (VL), CD4 count, and incidence of opportunistic infections (OIs) differ among individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) with or without SUD enrolled in AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP). ADAP is a program that supports individuals with or without insurance or financial resources to access necessary medications. Through this program patients are provided with medications services such as Medication therapy management (MTM) but can opt out of that option based on preference. This study will explore the effect of SUD, as well as HIV, on ART medication adherence and health outcomes specifically by evaluating patients based on refill history, demographics, and information provided from the MTM services if applicable. This will be a cohort study that will include data from January 2023 to October 2024."
1334 Patterns in Pennsylvania Pharmacy Openings and Closures in 2024,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study is to map community pharmacy openings and closures in Pennsylvania in 2024. A secondary objective is to describe the impact of pharmacy closures on healthcare access in communities with high social vulnerability index.
With the rising Direct and Indirect Remuneration (DIR) fees, lower dispensing reimbursement rates, and rising business costs, U.S. community pharmacies have been closing their doors. For many people, the pharmacist is their closest and most trusted health professional, meeting unmet healthcare needs in the community. Nearly 89% of the US population lives within 5 miles of a pharmacy.  Community pharmacies provide many non-dispensing patient care services including medication management and chronic disease state management. The combination of high accessibility and a wide array of clinical services makes pharmacies vital to the health of communities. When pharmacies close, patients in socially vulnerable areas may lose an access point to healthcare. 
There has been wide discussion regarding pharmacy closures across the county; however, new pharmacies are reported to have opened in the same time period. It is important to analyze these data to investigate patterns in the movement of community pharmacies away from already vulnerable populations."
1058 PATCHing the Gap: Development of an Equity Training for Pharmacist Contraception Prescribing,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this project was to engage reproductive health experts across several disciplines to create a supplemental equity focused training for pharmacists seeking to prescribe contraception in Indiana. 

Over the last decade, more than half of the states in the U.S. have adopted legislation allowing pharmacists to prescribe hormonal contraception in response to barriers faced by pregnancy-capable people. Despite permissive legislation, implementation and uptake of pharmacist contraception prescribing has been lower than desired. One documented barrier to implementation is the desire by pharmacists for additional training on contraception options and other related topics. In Indiana, pharmacists can prescribe self-administered hormonal contraception under a statewide standing order following completion of training on contraceptives."
1002 Analysis of Utilization of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors in Patients with Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease in a Primary Care Setting,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the proportion of patients with type-II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGTL2i) at two outpatient medical resident clinics. Secondary endpoints include the proportion of patients with T2DM and CKD (1) never prescribed an SGTL2i, (2) previously prescribed an SGLT2i but not currently on therapy, and (3) not currently on SGTL2i therapy but may qualify for initiation based on current clinical practice guidelines. T2DM is recognized as a significant risk factor for CKD, increasing the risk of premature cardiovascular disease and adverse clinical outcomes. Prior to the approval of SGT2is, the mainstay of treatment to slow the progression of CKD was through blood pressure management via renin-angiotensin system inhibition. However, neither angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis), or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) showed reduction in mortality or cardiovascular events in major CKD trials for patients with co-morbid T2DM. Recent landmark trials, including CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD, have shown significant renal and cardiovascular protection with SGLT2i use. The 2022 KDIGO guidelines now recommend the initiation of SGLT2is in patients with TDM and CKD with an eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73m2. Despite updated standard of care recommendations, studies have shown the uptake of SGLT2is in eligible patients is suboptimal in healthcare settings. By uncovering the underutilization of SGLTis, barriers to prescribing can be identified, leading to enhanced cardiorenal protection and a reduction in morbidity and mortality in eligible patients."
1198 Impact of a Pharmacist-Led Transitions of Care Program on Outcomes for Patients with Diabetes Mellitus,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Transitions between health care settings are a critical juncture for patients, associated with greater risks of adverse events, medication errors, and gaps in patient comprehension. Barriers such as increased cost of medications, limited health literacy, transportation or geographic access concerns, or cultural/psychosocial barriers can hinder care. Previous studies suggest that pharmacist involvement in transitions of care (TOC) is associated with better patient outcomes, and literature has specifically shown improved glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).  

In 2021, a pharmacist-led TOC program was formed to address some of the barriers to medication access and adherence for patients with select disease states including DM. The TOC program enrolls patients to receive a pharmacist assessment when admitted to the service, an inpatient visit or educational session before discharge, along with a phone call for follow-up at 7 days post-discharge. 

Objective: This study aims to assess the impact of a pharmacist-led TOC program on clinical outcomes for patients with DM who were enrolled in the program compared to standard of care. The primary outcome is the change in hemoglobin A1c (A1c) values from hospital index visit to 90 days. Secondary outcomes include hospitalization rates, emergency department (ED) visits, attendance at primary care/specialty visits, and the financial impact of medication access support."
1157 Adherence of Sickle Cell Disease Pain Management Protocol for Hospitalized Adults,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the adherence to our inpatient. Sickle cell disease (SCD) pain management protocol while the secondary objective is to analyze the pain management strategies. SCD is a homozygous recessive genetic disease that predominantly impacts African Americans. Due to an abnormal production of hemoglobin, the red blood cells polymerize into a sickle shape, adhere to one another and the blood vessel walls, and result in various complications including vaso-occlusion, anemia, acute chest syndrome, priapism in males, ischemia, venous thromboembolism, avascular necrosis, and other end-organ damages. Vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in patients with SCD is the most common reason for hospitalization. Opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the mainstays of SCD pain management. Poorly managed pain can result in psychological complications such as depression and anxiety."
1018 Implementing a Pneumonia Care Bundle on Hospital Mortality Rates Utilizing Pneumonia Severity Scoring,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Patient-related factors can influence mortality rates. Implementing a Pneumonia Care Bundle aims to standardize care, potentially reducing mortality among patients at higher risk, as identified through severity scoring. By focusing on key interventions, the bundle may also improve overall outcomes, providing a consistent approach to managing pneumonia severity. This study seeks to evaluate the effect of the care bundle on one year mortality rates stratified by pneumonia severity."
1112 Evaluating Antibiotic Medication Regimens in Patients with CKD through Creatinine Clearance Calculation: A Retrospective Study,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) can affect the way drugs are renally excreted from the body. This can alter the time it takes for a drug to be renally or hepatically cleared from systemic circulation. Such alteration may require the dosing of some drugs to be adjusted according to the patient’s creatinine clearance. Given that patients with CKD often require patient-specific dosing regimens, pharmacist interventions and recommendations are crucial for ensuring safe medication use and optimization. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of antibiotic dosing in patients with CKD through utilization of creatinine clearance. The secondary objective of this study is to create an antibiotic dose adjustment protocol for patients diagnosed with CKD being serviced at community-based pharmacies."
1197 Impact of a Pharmacist-led Medication-Assisted Weight Management Program on Quality of Life (QOL) and Skeletal Muscle Mass (SMM),2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a pharmacist-led medication-assisted weight loss program on the quality of life (QOL) and skeletal muscle mass (SMM) of ambulatory patients at an employer-based clinic. Weight loss goals for patients with obesity include achieving a healthy weight and maintaining a healthy weight over time. Studies have shown patients attempting weight loss without clinical supervision through lifestyle intervention with or without pharmacotherapy have the potential for negative health outcomes including malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, muscle wasting, and dehydration. Furthermore, weight loss should ideally be from the fat mass compartment, which is the main driver of metabolic disease; however, several studies have shown that weight loss in general is associated with the loss of tissue from the fat-free compartment, especially skeletal muscle. The loss of skeletal muscle mass can lead to poor quality of life for patients due to the associated increased risk of fall, fractures, disability, and even increased mortality rates. A few studies have evaluated the impact of a pharmacist-run weight loss clinic, suggesting pharmacists can improve weight-loss and weight-related comorbidities in patients with obesity. Additionally, studies have shown improved QOL after surgical and non-surgical weight loss, but the impact of pharmacist-assisted weight loss on QOL is not clearly demonstrated. Furthermore, it is unknown what impact a pharmacist-led medication-assisted weight loss program has on the QOL and SMM of patients."
1049 Evaluating the Long-term Impact of a Pharmacist Primary Care Certificate Training Program,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Pharmacists have the necessary skills to help address the growing primary care provider shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034; however, quickly ramping up a pharmacist workforce may be a challenge. Certificate-based continuing pharmacy education (CPE) is an evidence-based means to demonstrate sustained competence and engage practicing pharmacists in professional development to develop the necessary skills to become specialized whilst also satisfying active licensure requirements. Certificate programs that meet the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education standards are defined as activities that “systematically acquire specific knowledge, skills, attitudes, and performance behaviors that expand or enhance practice competencies.” In 2021, the novel Pharmacist Primary Care Certificate Training Program was launched at the study institution with the purpose of scaling up a primary care pharmacist workforce. Over three years and six cohorts, 44 pharmacist learners across the United States and internationally have completed this program. Short-term data shows that 97.73% of learners either partially or fully achieved their self-developed SMART goals by the end of program completion; however, practice change and long-term impact is unknown. The long-term goal is to use the primary care certificate to equip pharmacists to successfully practice in primary care. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term impact of the 12-week, 30-hour Pharmacist Primary Care Certificate Training Program."
1256 Clinical impact of a pharmacist collaborative practice agreement on Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) quality measures for diabetes,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study is to assess the impact of a pharmacist collaborative practice agreement on CMS quality measures for diabetes by comparing measure achievement in the collaborative practice group to a physician-only managed group. As healthcare continues to evolve, so do reimbursement models. As healthcare evolves from fee-for-service to value-based care models, there is an increasing emphasis on quality over volume. These value-based models aim to hold providers more accountable for patient outcomes by incentivizing or rewarding health care organizations for meeting various quality measures that aim to improve quality, cost, and equity for patients. If these quality measures are not met, then the health care organizations may lose a portion of their payment from payers. In these value-based models, pharmacists can play a vital role in ensuring patients meet quality measures for health system reimbursement."
1003 Blood pressure in young adults in Iowa,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Hypertension (HTN) among young adults is a common health problem, but not widely noticeable or identified. Adults aged 18-40 years in the US had an estimated HTN prevalence of 22.4%. Even at a young age, the presence of HTN increases the risk of cardiovascular events, including heart failure, stroke, and myocardial infarction. Young adults perceive themselves as healthy and often do not attend regular health screenings. Accordingly, many chronic diseases are not diagnosed unless people have a family history or identifiable symptoms. This study aims to identify adults with high blood pressure (HBP) aged 18-40 at the University of Iowa Healthcare (UIH) and determine the percentage of patients diagnosed with HTN within two years and factors associated with timely diagnosis."
1120 Insights on antifungal therapeutic drug monitoring from infectious diseases physicians and hospital-based pharmacists: a focus group analysis,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Antifungal therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is critical for individualized, precision treatment and prevention of fungal infections. Previous research has highlighted low TDM utilization rates, potentially reflecting challenges with long turnaround times, complex testing logistics, results interpretation, and cost. As experts in drug mechanisms and pharmacokinetics, pharmacists can lead antifungal TDM in partnership with infectious diseases (ID) physicians. To inform strategies to increase antifungal TDM use, we conducted focus group discussions with ID physicians and hospital or ID pharmacists."
1117 Impact of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment on the Medication Regimen Complexity Index and Potentially Inappropriate Medications,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) on medication regimen complexity index (MRCI) score and number of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) in elderly patients with cognitive symptoms.  Medication regimen complexity (MRC) and use of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) have been associated with adverse drug events (ADEs), non-adherence, re-hospitalization, and all cause-mortality. Medication regimen review and pharmacotherapy consultation may play a role in reducing MRC and PIMs. Comprehensive geriatric assessment is a multidimensional, interprofessional intervention designed to optimize treatment for elderly patients. Limited research has explored the effect of CGA on MRC or PIMs."
1251 Association of Medication Complexity with Patient Medication Experience,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This study examined the correlation between Iowa Medication Complexity Score (IMECS) and patient experiences with their medication therapy. IMECS, a measure of medication regimen complexity, has been used to match patient needs to service intensity. However, IMECS has not been studied to determine its association with patient-reported outcomes and experiences related to medication use. Better understanding of how IMECS relates to patient-reported data can advance its use for managing populations of community-based patients. The objective of this study was to examine the association of medication complexity with self-reported patient health indicators and medication-related experiences."
1152 Over-the-counter Hearing Aids: A Secret Shopper Study of Community Pharmacies in Pennsylvania,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study is to describe the availability of over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids  and pharmacy teams’ awareness of these devices in community pharmacies in Pennsylvania. Hearing loss is a significant health concern in the U.S. as it affects approximately 37.5 million Americans. It is expected that 28.8 million U.S. adults would likely benefit from the use of hearing aids, yet the prevalence of use is only 1 in 5. After the approval of OTC hearing aids in 2022, community pharmacies have been identified as uniquely positioned to offer these devices at community pharmacies to increase patient access to solutions for hearing loss. OTC hearing aids are available to patients without a comprehensive hearing exam and without the need for professional fitting or adjustments. However, it may still be helpful for patients to interact with a healthcare professional at or after the time of purchase to aid in device setup, troubleshooting, and maintenance. Our results will showcase the current availability of OTC hearing aids in community pharmacies across Pennsylvania and gauge pharmacy team awareness of and preparedness to assist with these devices."

The main objective of this study was to assess the knowledge of community pharmacists regarding Beers Criteria and Potentially Inappropriate Medication (PIMs) among older adults in Pakistan.  A descriptive cross sectional study design was used. Pre-validated questionnaire(in-person) AGS Beers Criteria and STOPP/START Criteria (Screening Tool of Older Person’s Prescriptions/Screening Tool to Alert doctors to Right Treatment) was used. Convenience sampling technique was used to collect the data from 388 respondents. Simple random sampling was then employed for the selection of 3010 prescriptions from pharmacy record to evaluate PIMS. Data was cleaned, coded and analyzed using SPSS vs. 21. A total of 388 community pharmacists participated in the study. Only 21.6% (n=84) of the community pharmacists were aware of Beers Criteria whereas 7.7% (n=30) were familiar of latest update Beers Criteria. Only 7% of the community pharmacist regularly used Beer Criteria in Practice. However, most pharmacists reported good practices when dealing with older customers in terms of asking relevant questions, considering age, referring to other resources, and regularly updating their knowledge through continuous professional development. The study revealed low awareness of Beers Criteria among community pharmacists in Pakistan. However, those who were aware of Beers Criteria demonstrated improved knowledge concerning PIMs in older adults. Therefore, there is a need to enhance the application and awareness of Beers Criteria among community pharmacists. Additionally, using the STOPP/START criteria, the study highlighted Pharmacist role in identifying the significant inappropriate prescribing events (both PIMs and PPOs) in older adults. This research provides the evidence to improve the professional development."

Social media is increasingly used as a resource for health information by consumers. However, it is recognized that there is a degree of misinformation present in these social media resources. One way to combat this misinformation is to have health professionals provide reputable information through social media. In the pharmacy profession, there is relatively limited published research about pharmacists’ use of social media to provide health information to consumers. Additionally, there is limited formal guidance for pharmacists about the most effective way to set up and interact with consumers using social media."
1381 Empirical Validity of Serum Creatinine Availability in a Community Setting and Impact of Medication Dosing,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"In the community-based pharmacy setting, pharmacists verify and dispense medications while often being unaware of their patient’s kidney function status without access to laboratory values (e.g. serum creatine, weight). Current barriers in community-based pharmacy, such as lack of data utilization due to computer systems not possessing the capacity for laboratory value storage and general access to such laboratory values. A study evaluating the pharmacist’s role in ensuring adequate dose adjustments found pharmacist-interventions resulted in identification and resolution of medication dosing errors as well as improvement in the collaborative relationship between provider and pharmacist. As community pharmacies shift towards value-based models of care and pharmacoequity, the role of standardized laboratory collection in community settings is paramount. The role of quality and safety measures in community-based pharmacy has been overlooked and instead patients choose their pharmacies based on medication costs, due to “plan-preferred” insurance parameters. Instead, patients should place their overall health, including safety measures, as the preferential for selecting a pharmacy. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate medication regimen safety for patients with altered kidney function and type 2 diabetes on diabetic medications serviced at community-based pharmacies. The secondary objective of this study is to create a dose adjustment protocol for community-based pharmacies when dispensing diabetic medications to patients diagnosed with CKD."
1192 From Concept to Clinic: Establishing a Pharmacogenomics Clinic  to Return Preemptive Test Results,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Pharmacogenomic test results have life-long implications for medication therapy. The return of pharmacogenomic results to patients and families has the potential to improve patient understanding of their results. Additionally, discussions during counseling sessions can facilitate the sharing of pharmacogenomic test results by patients with their other healthcare providers. To support this effort, a pharmacist-led pharmacogenomics clinic was established at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital to offer individualized gene-based medication counseling and educational resources to patients and families. 

Session objectives are as follows:
1. Understand key implementation strategies for the development of a preemptive pharmacogenomics clinic in a pediatric setting.
2. Develop effective communication strategies and educational material to counsel patients and caregivers about pharmacogenomic test results."
1173 Assessment of insulin adherence before and after use of a Continuous Glucose Monitoring System,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study was to compare insulin adherence in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes in the 6-month timeframe before and after the use of a Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGM). Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems track blood glucose levels continuously, day and night. CGMs use a small sensor on the skin that measures glucose levels every few minutes, sending the data to a smartphone or monitor. This allows patients to see trends in their blood glucose and make quick adjustments to their medication, diet, or physical activity. CGM has been shown to improve glycemic control and reduce hypoglycemic episodes in patients with diabetes. An essential factor to consider with CGMs is patient comfort and satisfaction. This includes whether using CGMs improves their quality of life and makes them feel safer. In one study investigating the impact of CGM on quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes, 80% of participants were using the Freestyle Libre system, and 71% were taking insulin. The study surveyed patients and found that 97% reported a positive impact from using CGM. Some of the survey responses included: “Better understanding of my diabetes and the things that affect my sugar levels” (95% agreed); “More consistent about adjusting my insulin dosages” (92% agreed); “More consistent about adjusting my eating based on my sugar levels” (91% agreed); and “More consistent in taking care of my health overall” (91% agreed). Additionally, the percentage of participants checking their blood glucose at least three times a day increased from 30% before using CGM to 100% after starting CGM. This study showed that most patients felt more comfortable managing their diabetes and overall health after using CGM. This improvement may be due to the real-time feedback on their sugar levels, which helps them make lifestyle adjustments more effectively. However, its association with insulin adherence remains unclear."
1145 Evaluating a Radiopharmaceutical ITLC Cassette system (T-Cassette) for precision and accuracy when used in hospital hot labs for emergency preparation,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Objectives: Before a nuclear medicine procedure can be performed the radiopharmaceutical must be prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. If the radiochemical purity is below industry standards, unexpected patterns of radiopharmaceutical biodistribution will put a
patient at risk for increased radiation exposure, potential misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. The last step before patient administration is to determine the chemical binding of the radionuclide to the chelator. The chelator will determine where the drug will be distributed in the body. To determine the purity of the radiopharmaceutical preparation, the radiochemical purity will be assessed by instant thin layer chromatography (ITLC) analysis. Verifying the radiochemical purity (RCP) of radiopharmaceuticals before administration is described as the minimum standard in the USP General Chapter <825>. The current method for technetium-99m instant thin layer chromatography (ITLC) analysis involves operator dependent measurements for marking, spotting, solvent selection, developing, cutting and calculations of the TLC strips. We will evaluate a new device for ease of use in the nuclear medicine department. The device allows a user who has not performed RCP before to do so accurately and precisely, eliminating the common pitfalls of ITLC. The device is intended for any person or department that prepares FDA radiopharmaceuticals. Our primary objective is to evaluate the radiopharmaceutical ITLC cassette system, referred to as the T-Cassette, for precision and accuracy when used in the hospital hot lab for preparations of technetium-99m labeled radiopharmaceuticals. The second objective is to gain feedback on the T-Cassette versus the commonly used ITLC methods used in departments."

1404 Toolkit to Initiate Pharmacist-Led Harm Reduction Services in Community Pharmacy Settings,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this project is to create an expert-informed toolkit for pharmacy teams to implement harm reduction (HR) services for people who use drugs within community pharmacy settings. Toolkits and resources for harm reduction for pharmacy teams exist, but these resources lack specific information on how to implement these services within community pharmacies. A pharmacist-led HR research pilot study is currently ongoing at two sites in Pittsburgh, PA – one community pharmacy and one general internal medicine clinic. The pilot is being conducted to gather information on how to initiate harm reduction services provided by pharmacists in these settings. Harm reduction services offered as part of the pilot consist of: (1) safer injection kits; (2) wound care kits; (3) drug testing kits (fentanyl and xylazine test strips); (4) harm reduction education; (5) non-prescription syringe sales; (6) naloxone; and (7) syringe disposal kits. Data from this pilot includes patient and pharmacy team experiences with pharmacist-led harm reduction services and is collected through team member pre- and post-intervention interviews and patient satisfaction surveys."
1330 Identifying Best Practices for Social Determinants of Health Referrals in Community Pharmacies,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this project is to identify facilitators, barriers and best practice recommendations for providing Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) referrals for patients in community pharmacies.   Community pharmacies are highly accessible to individuals affected by SDOH, and pharmacy teams are well-positioned to screen for SDOH and offer the necessary support. The Pennsylvania Pharmacists Care Network (PPCN) is a network of over 200 community pharmacies committed to providing high-quality, patient-centered care. In 2022, PPCN established several contracts with regional Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MCO) to provide SDOH screening and referrals. To our knowledge, PPCN is among the first networks in the nation to receive reimbursement from a MCO for SDOH services provided by community pharmacy teams. Common barriers to pharmacy team implementation of SDOH referrals previously reported include the integration of the service within pharmacy workflow, limited reimbursement to provide these services, lack of pharmacy team training, and the need for efficient documentation of services to facilitate future patient follow-up. Further research is needed to understand best practices for pharmacy team-provided referral and follow-up processes within SDOH services."

Glucagon-like-peptide1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have gained popularity given their promising efficacy in weight loss as well as their initial indications for type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 RAs,  such as tirzepatide (Zepbound®), semaglutide (Wegovy®), and liraglutide (Saxenda®) have shown an average weight loss of 5.5% (95% CI, 21.2% to 17.7%) from weeks 36-88, 12.44% (95% CI: 11.51% 13.37%) at week 68, and 5.4% (95% CI:  5.0%, 5.8%) at week 56, respectively. As the demand for GLP-1 RA medications rises, so do the barriers to access. These barriers include delays in time to access due to prior authorizations, insurance coverage restrictions, and limited availability. As a result, many patients have experienced confusion, miscommunication, and medication errors. Given pharmacists' expertise in medication management and insurance navigation, their integration into care teams may offer solutions to these barriers. University hospitals in Colorado have integrated the pharmacist team into their primary care model for obesity management, providing specialized support and interventions to enhance patient care. In this study, we aim to evaluate the effect of streamlined GLP-1 RA access and treatment outcomes with and without pharmacist-led interventions to understand the impact of pharmacist roles in the integrated-care team for weight management."

While awareness is growing, little is known about the public's comfort and confidence in using FTS. This study aims to assess the general public's comfort and self-efficacy in using FTS in the U.S. Using a cross-sectional survey of adults aged 18+ recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk, we will measure comfort (7 items) and confidence (12 items) in FTS use via Likert-type scales. The analysis will include descriptive statistics and Mann-Whitney U tests to explore differences in comfort and confidence by sex, race, age, and geographic region. Results will provide insights into how social and behavioral factors influence the use of harm reduction tools, guiding future public health interventions aimed at increasing FTS utilization to reduce opioid overdoses. Data collection is ongoing, with findings expected by November 2024."
1140 Implementation and Evaluation of a Naltrexone Extended-Release Injectable Administration Service in an Independent Pharmacy,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Objectives: 1. Develop and implement a process that addresses the logistical barriers to administering naltrexone extended-release injectables in a community pharmacy 2. Describe the demographics of the patients who are eligible and receive naltrexone extended-release injectables at a community pharmacy and their use of the program 3. Administer a patient satisfaction survey including open-ended data about patient experience with the program Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, is available as an extended-release injectable and can be used to treat alcohol use disorder. This long-acting injection can support enhanced adherence and outcomes but faces logistical barriers to administration. These accessibility barriers are partly due to the requirement for healthcare professional administration, high cost, and a practice known as “white bagging”. White bagging grants insurance companies control over medication purchase, preparation, and administration. White bagging can hinder care coordination, requiring healthcare providers to navigate complex processes and often prioritize insurance requirements over patient needs. Many health institutions have policies against white bagging creating further challenges in administering such medications. This can result in therapeutic decisions that favor policy and logistics rather than the most effective treatment for the patient. To address these challenges, a potential solution involves partnerships between health-system prescribers and non-affiliated, community pharmacies. Patients' insurance-preferred specialty pharmacies can dispense and deliver the medication directly to local pharmacies, which can be administered after verification. The implementation and success of this patient care service will be evaluated by detailing the processes and conducting patient satisfaction surveys. These outcomes will enhance current research on pharmacist-administered long-acting injectables, while also outlining how pharmacists can expand their skills to administer a wider variety of medications."

Background: AI/ML technologies are increasingly integrated into medical devices designed for patient use. To ensure the safety, effectiveness, and transparency of these devices, the FDA has established regulatory efforts, including the AI/ML Action Plan and Good Machine Learning Practice (GMLP) guidelines, which emphasize transparency, patient safety, and continuous monitoring of AI systems. Despite these initiatives, concerns remain about how effectively manufacturers communicate key information to patients such as device functionality, data usage, and risks. This review evaluates labeling and information-sharing practices by manufacturers, discussing potential gaps in transparency and accessibility that could affect safe and informed use of AI/ML-enabled devices."
1128 The Impact of Pharmacist Interventions on Symptom Management in Patients with Cancer,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Objective: To assess the impact of a pharmacist’s presence and involvement with the care team in a community cancer center on symptom control in patients with cancer.

Background: People with cancer often face a variety of distressing symptoms, including pain, nausea, breathlessness, constipation, diarrhea, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and mood changes. The Journal of Clinical Oncology reports that patients with cancer often experience more than one symptom from their disease at one time, and patients with metastatic disease and breathlessness have an average of 14 symptoms that are uncontrolled.1 Unmanaged symptoms can significantly diminish the quality of life for patients and may indicate poorer outcomes. Effectively addressing their symptoms can greatly improve their well-being and ideally make a difference in their mood and outlook for their disease and life. Integrating a dedicated pharmacist into a community cancer center for symptom management could enhance symptom control and improve patient outcomes.

1278 Exploring Public Acceptance and Comfort with Pharmacy-based Sexual Health Services,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Pharmacists play a pivotal role in providing sexual and reproductive health services, including education, counseling, and point-of-care test and treat services for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV). While pharmacists' contributions to improving sexual health outcomes are well-documented, public willingness to engage with them on sensitive topics remains underexplored. Despite previous research focusing on pharmacists' comfort, little is known about patient perspectives, particularly regarding barriers like privacy concerns, social acceptability, and discomfort discussing personal issues. College age individuals are one of the populations at highest risk of acquiring an STI, likely not to identify a primary care provider, and can offer relevant insights into public attitudes toward sexual health discussions in pharmacy settings. This study aims to assess public comfort in discussing sexual health with pharmacists and pharmacy technicians, and their willingness to utilize services like STI testing and sexual health education. By identifying these challenges, the study seeks to inform strategies to make pharmacies more approachable for sexual health services, improve public access, reduce stigma, and ultimately promote better health outcomes."

1300 Perceived value of postgraduate year 1 community pharmacy residencies among penultimate-year US doctor of pharmacy students,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Objective/Background: 
The primary objective of this study is to describe the perceived value of postgraduate year one community pharmacy residency programs (PGY-1 CPRP) among penultimate-year (P3) US Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students. The secondary objectives are to describe the perceived value of CPRP’s in P3 students with exposure to community pharmacy residency sites versus those whose have not been exposed, to describe the perceived value of CPRP’s in P3 students who are planning to pursue residency versus those who are not, and to describe the perceived value of CPRP’s in P3 students who perceive there to be a negative stigma around community pharmacies versus those who do not.   

Many pharmacy students desire to complete a residency post-graduation with the majority of interest focused on ambulatory care and acute care residencies. CPRP’s offer clinical experiences, medication therapy management opportunities, and community outreach experiences. They allow the resident to gain skills in management, patient care, and research while also allowing the resident to build confidence as a pharmacist. However, community pharmacy residencies are not often well-promoted and consequently may be viewed with skepticism. Currently, there is a lower number of applicants for PGY-1 CPRPs compared to the number of open positions. In comparison to health system residency programs (HSRP’s) who have a larger applicant pool and higher match rate. Match rates for HSRP’s for 2024 were 85.1% compared to a 62.5% match rate for CPRP’s. Students in their final year of pharmacy school found more value in PGY-1 CPRP’s than students in their third year did. Potentially, due to the lack of exposure to community pharmacies and community pharmacy residencies, they may not know the actual value of PGY-1 CPRP’s. Confirming this lack of knowledge and exposure of P3 students can assist programs in developing marketing and increasing interest in PGY-1 CPRP’s."

While cases of gonorrhea have decreased since 2021, cases of chlamydia and syphilis are on the rise. Due to the overall increase in STIs, they are being considered as a public health priority in the U.S., especially within at-risk populations. This has led to an interest in prophylactic therapies. Doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (DoxyPEP) was evaluated in a pilot study in 2011. Since then, it has been investigated as a possible prophylactic therapy and has shown efficacy in multiple trials."
1038 Continuing professional development self-reporting by board-certified pharmacists,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This project aims to monitor the uptake of continuing professional development (CPD) self-reporting amongst board-certified pharmacists throughout 2024. CPD can be defined as a commitment to life-long learning through a process of intentional reflection, planning, learning, evaluation, and application while recording and reviewing each component throughout the process. The American Pharmacists Association maintains House of Delegates policy supporting pharmacists’ participation in CPD, along with several other national and international pharmacy organizations. CPD is utilized by pharmacists outside of the United States for maintaining and/or enhancing professional competencies; however, within the United States, uptake of CPD by pharmacists has been limited. Pharmacists must meet eligibility criteria including education, licensure, and practice experience requirements and achieve a successful score on the certification examination to earn board certification. The process validates the knowledge, skills, and experience necessary to provide advanced patient care in specialized settings, populations, or therapeutic areas. Board-certified pharmacists must maintain and obtain competencies relevant to their specialty practice area throughout the lifetime of the certification. The Board of Pharmacy Specialties (BPS) began integration of CPD into the recertification framework for board-certified pharmacists in January 2024. CPD is being implemented as part of the BPS recertification framework in response to feedback from board-certified pharmacists who emphasized the need for flexible, contemporary, interactive, low-cost activities as part of maintaining continued competence in their specialty practice area. As the first large-scale implementation for a CPD framework, monitoring the initiative for quality improvement opportunities is critical."

Medication and patient safety have been widely evaluated in the inpatient healthcare setting, but minimal research has evaluated patient safety culture in the ambulatory care setting. Furthermore, robust medication error reporting structures exist in most inpatient settings but are rare in ambulatory settings. Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians are educated and familiar with patient safety, medication safety, and error reporting, but other healthcare professionals may not be as familiar with these concepts and best practices. The results of this research can be used to develop targeted education related to patient safety culture and medication error reporting for pharmacy and non-pharmacy personnel and guide the implementation of error reporting processes."
1019 Implementing Pharmacist-Led Diabetes Management in a Chain Retail Pharmacy,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study is to pilot a pharmacist-led diabetes management program that increases patient access to retail pharmacy-based diabetes care while addressing the logistical requirements for maintaining such services. The complexity of diabetes management, including access to care and socioeconomic factors, often requires a multi-disciplinary approach to adequately address patients’ needs. Expert coalitions, like the American Diabetes Association, have declared that pharmacists can serve an important role on such interprofessional healthcare teams. Although previous literature on pharmacist-led diabetes interventions primarily occurs in ambulatory and inpatient settings, data have demonstrated that community pharmacists are uniquely positioned to provide highly accessible care and contribute to the management of the disease state. 
A meta-analysis revealed that diabetes-related interventions in the retail pharmacy setting have the potential for success but struggle with sustainability due to limited resources and workflow practice (Presley, 2019). Most of these projects attempted to implement several components of diabetes management at once (e.g., A1c monitoring, disease state education, health disparity mitigation), potentially at the detriment to the intervention’s longevity. A more focused methodology may help with navigating the barriers that community pharmacists face when cultivating expanded patient services. This study is aimed at delivering comprehensive patient education that encourages effective self-management of diabetes mellitus."
1181 Enhancing Patient-Centered Care: A Pharmacy-Led Approach to Hypertension Management through the HBMP Program,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Hypertension is one of the important public health challenges in the United States due to its high prevalence (estimated 30%-50%), severe complications, and significant economic burden ($131-$198 billion annually). Particularly, American Indians and Alaska natives have 10% higher risk of hypertension and 50% higher risk of hypertension-associated cardiovascular disease compared to non-Hispanic whites. Appropriate management and medication adherence continue to be a crucial obstacle in achieving blood pressure (BP) control. Studies have shown that pharmacists engaged in Collaborative Practice Agreements (CPAs) or interdisciplinary primary care teams have a positive impact on clinical outcomes and improvements in BP control. An urban Indian Health and Family Services initiated the Hypertension Benefits Management Program (HBMP) through the Collaborative Practice Agreements (CPAs). In this program, pharmacists provided medication management and adherence counseling to improve patients’ hypertension management. Therefore, the aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of a pharmacy-based intervention through the HBMP program among American Indians and Alaska natives."
1239 Addressing System Barriers in the Role of the Ambulatory Care Pharmacist,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This study aims to explore the key stresses and successes experienced by pharmacists working in the ambulatory care setting. Ambulatory care pharmacists provide chronic disease state management, refine medication regimens, and educate patients and providers on medications.  Working in a clinical role can be professionally satisfying; however, the demands of patient care coupled with administrative tasks can present challenges for these pharmacists. Some of the stresses imposed on these pharmacists include system barriers, or factors external to the pharmacist that shape the environment in which they practice."

Patients who undergo bariatric surgery are at risk for bone loss which can result in osteoporosis and fracture. National guidelines recommend screening for osteoporosis using a DXA scan two years after surgery. Mountain Area Health Education Center (MAHEC) Family Health Center has an Osteoporosis Clinic that serves as a referral clinic for primary care providers; however, it is not known whether screening is appropriately occurring for this patient population."
1031 Targeting the Hemopexin Domain of Matrix Metalloproteinase-3 with Small Molecule Inhibitors in Cisplatin Resistant Ovarian Cancer,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, claiming approximately 180,000 lives globally each year. Standard treatment includes cytoreductive surgery and platinum/taxane-based intravenous chemotherapy. However, over 70% of women develop resistance to this first-line treatment. This underscores the urgent need for more effective treatments for women with advanced and drug-resistant OC. Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) are enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix. The MMPs protein structure includes three domains, the propeptide, catalytic, and hemopexin domains.  MMPs dysregulation is associated with cancer initiation, progression, and drug resistance. Preliminary studies found that matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3), a member of the MMPs, is upregulated in cisplatin-resistant as compared with cisplatin-sensitive OC cells. Clinical trials with small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) targeting the catalytic domain of MMPs failed due to undesirable secondary effects. Evidence indicate that the hemopexin domain of MMPs interacts with other proteins that promotes the growth and proliferation of cancerous cells. This study aims to target the hemopexin domain of MMP3 with SMIs as a potential approach to overcome chemoresistance of OC cells."
1105 A habit-based intervention to support medication adherence in primary care.,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objectvives of this study are to 1) test the habit worksheet in a sample of patients starting new prescriptions compared to a standard education condition. and 2.) compare baseline measures of medication-taking routine, automaticity, and beliefs about medicines, and self-reported adherence. The rationale is that medication adherence is often conceptualized as intentional and non-intentional factors. A third factor may help explain medication-taking behaviors – habit. The present study pilots a habit worksheet to assist patients prescribed new medications in developing their habit."
1402 Tennessee Pharmacists� Knowledge and Perception of Dispensing Buprenorphine in Practice,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study was to assess pharmacists’ knowledge and perceptions of dispensing buprenorphine/naloxone. Despite federal and state initiatives and evidence supporting medications for opioid use disorder (OUD) in reducing morbidity, mortality, and increasing treatment retention, the opioid epidemic in the United States (US) remains a critical public health issue. Pharmacists are viewed as highly accessible providers, yet studies have shown that 1 in 5 pharmacies in the US with high opioid-related mortality rates refuse to dispense buprenorphine. Tennessee (TN) has the second highest rate of drug overdose mortality in the US, with approximately 70,000 Tennesseans estimated to have OUD. While opioid prescriptions have decreased and buprenorphine prescriptions have increased, all drug overdose deaths in TN continue to rise, with 3,814 deaths reported in 2021."
1041 Did the COVID-19 Pandemic Affect Student Pharmacist Positivity about the Profession of Pharmacy?,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study was to analyze the trend amongst graduating student pharmacists regarding their positivity towards a career in pharmacy, and to determine if the trend was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The pharmacy marketplace has gone through considerable changes in recent years.  Prior to the pandemic, the decline in job openings, stagnant growth in wages, and negative publicity about adverse working conditions for some pharmacists, may have tarnished the optimism of young pharmacists towards the profession of pharmacy.  While the pandemic became a major stressor for pharmacists and students, it is not clear how this affected the opinions of students regarding the profession of pharmacy."
1124 Provider acceptance rate of pharmacist-recommended statin therapy for patients being treated for human immunodeficiency virus,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to determine the 30-day acceptance rate of a recommendation made by an human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) specialty pharmacist for the initiation of statin therapy in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy for HIV who are eligible to receive moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy.  The secondary objective is to describe provider reason(s) for rejection of the recommendation. 
Patients living with HIV are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease due to chronic inflammation and the effects of antiretroviral therapy. Statins have been shown to significantly reduce total cholesterol but are under prescribed in this patient population. In July 2023, the REPRIEVE trial showed that statins provide cardiovascular benefit even in patients with HIV at low risk for cardiovascular disease, and in February 2024 the US Department of Health and Human Services updated their Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Adults and Adolescents with HIV to include guidance on statin therapy. For patients aged 40-75 years who have low-to-intermediate (<20%) 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk estimates, at least moderate-intensity statin therapy is now recommended. Because this update is recent, information about the rate of acceptance and implementation into clinical practice for patients living with HIV is not yet available.  
This study seeks to provide insight into how successfully guideline directed-medical therapy is being adopted into real-life practice for the care of patients with HIV. It will also describe the relevance of pharmacist interventions in this area of practice, guide future interventions for our patients' benefit, and explain why a recommendation for statin therapy may not be accepted by providers."
1044 Establishing Measures of Quality for Community-based Pharmacy Practice Experiential Education,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"With grant support from the Community Pharmacy Foundation, the primary objective of this study is to establish criteria for “high quality” community-based pharmacy practice experiential sites. Secondary objectives include mapping best practice experiential activities to Curriculum Outcomes and Entrustable Professional Activities (COEPA) standards and creating a resource guide for academic institutions to adopt the criteria definition. 

Community-based pharmacy practice is the front door of our profession and involving student pharmacists in community pharmacy practice transformation is essential to ensure this transformation continues.  Currently students across the country receive varying experiences during their intermediate pharmacy practice experiences (IPPE) and advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) rotations, specifically at their local community-based pharmacy practice sites. Students must be placed in optimal community-based pharmacy practice sites for experiential education to be exposed to transformative practice efforts and to improve perceptions of this practice setting. There needs to be a consensus definition that would allow for objective identification of a “high-quality” community-based pharmacy experiential education site."
1241 An Innovative Platform for Facilitating the Delivery of Clinical Pharmacy Services.,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Clinical pharmacy services is a relatively new concept in India, which gained attention after Pharm.D was introduced in India in 2008. As part of 6 year Pharm.D in India, students visit the hospital from 2nd year and are expected to actively contribute to patient care in the 5th and 6th year. Various factors like unawareness about clinical pharmacy activities, inadequate training, non-existent to inconsistent documentation practices, limited support from the hospital, lack of tools, limit the ability of students to deliver clinical pharmacy services and contribute to patient care.
To address the above issues and empower PharmDs  to deliver exceptional patient care, a novel digital platform was developed. The platform introduces a structured approach for executing clinical pharmacy services with a focus on key performance indicators. Clinical pharmacy services provided by PharmDs are documented in a structured format for the preceptor to review, give specific feedback for improvement and approval. Summary of clinical pharmacy activities approved is presented on a dashboard. An AI tool is embedded in the platform to assist PharmDs to execute the activities."
1194 Impact of a community-based specialty pharmacist in identifying drug therapy problems for new adult oncology patients,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this retrospective cohort study is to characterize the value of the community-based specialty pharmacist in identifying drug therapy problems in new to treatment adult oncology patients when a pharmacist is and is not embedded on the patient’s clinical care team. Existing research underscores the significant impact of oncology pharmacists, particularly in identifying drug therapy problems during the prescription verification process. However, there remains a gap in understanding the role of community-based specialty pharmacists in outpatient settings, particularly in scenarios where pharmacists are not embedded in clinical care teams. Specialty pharmacists are trained to understand and appropriately address the complexities of managing oral cancer treatment to correctly identify drug therapy problems. This includes issues such as dosing errors, drug-drug interactions, inappropriate indications and directions for use, and the absence of supportive care medications. These inadequacies can negatively impact patient safety and quality of life as well as treatment efficacy. Better patient outcomes are expected with pharmacists on the care team; however, it is unknown whether or not this is true in this specific patient population which includes oncology patients in the outpatient, community-based setting."

1242 Antiemetic Medication Prescribing Patterns in an Outpatient Oncology Clinic in Accordance with Established Guidelines,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective of this study was to describe the prescription patterns of antiemetics for the prevention and management of antineoplastic drug-induced nausea and vomiting (ANDINV) in an outpatient infusion clinic (OPIC), with a focus on physician prescription compliance to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. Prescription of prophylactic antiemetics in oncology patients should be an utmost practice by clinicians since nausea and vomiting are among the most common and distressing acute side effects of cancer treatment. Consequently, organizations such as the NCCN have created antiemetic guidelines based on the emetic risk of anticancer agents. If not effectively prevented, ANDINV can have detrimental effects, including fatigue, dehydration, malnutrition, and even premature withdrawal from therapy, negatively impacting outcomes. Assessing how well guidelines are being met will make the institution aware of the approach needed to enhance supportive care and identify areas for improvement. Pharmacists play a critical role in this process by identifying gaps, leading protocol development, and supporting multidisciplinary teams to improve compliance and outcomes."

Background – At the conclusion of 5th visit [240 days] after the start of randomized control study on “pharmacist intervention on hypertension”, we found that while 44 out of 90 patients in the pharmacist intervention group had their blood pressure fully controlled i.e SBP <120 and DBP < 80 and rest were pre-hypertensive, not a single patient in the non-intervention group had their blood pressure under control and 82 of them were hypertensive i.e SBP > 140 or DBP > 90 and remaining 8 were pre-hypertensive. It was ethically imperative for us to extend the study and see whether pharmacist intervention could benefit these patients who were originally in the non-intervention group."
1302 Pharmacist Medical Billing within Medicaid Programs: National Landscape and Opportunities in Pennsylvania,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Objectives: 
1) Categorize and describe current opportunities for pharmacists in community-based pharmacies to bill Medicaid for enhanced pharmacy services in select states across the country and; 2) Compare and contrast these opportunities with those in Pennsylvania. 

Background:
Pharmacists have historically been recognized as the most accessible healthcare providers, and community-based pharmacies provide a critical access point to healthcare for the public. Over time, pharmacists have gained the ability to provide and bill as recognized providers for various enhanced pharmacy services such as smoking cessation counseling, medication therapy management, and health and wellness screenings. Much of this progress with pharmacist medical billing has occurred at the state level through recognition and payment by Medicaid plans. According to APhA in September 2024, 36 states currently allow pharmacists to perform medical billing to commercial or Medicaid plans. As of March 1st, 2024, Pennsylvania Medicaid allows pharmacists to enroll as mid-level providers, which has led to contracting for pharmacist-provided services with state Medicaid and Medicaid managed care organizations. There is no single, comprehensive resource that outlines the medical billing landscape under Medicaid for pharmacists nationwide, encompassing the variability and successes of implementation. Without this, pharmacists in states with new medical billing opportunities under Medicaid may find implementation difficult as they cannot quickly learn from the experiences of other states. While this project does not seek to fill the gap of a single resource, its purpose is to summarize relevant Medicaid medical billing opportunities within select states, to compare these with Pennsylvania, and to ultimately inform the implementation of these opportunities in Pennsylvania community pharmacies."

Our standard institutional HIHN included an optional 80 unit/kg bolus dose and a starting infusion rate of 18 units/kg/hr utilizing actual body weight without a dose cap. Heparin is primarily contained within the blood, but blood volume does not increase linearly with weight. Therefore, optimal dosing in obese patients is an area of ongoing debate. A previous MUE conducted within our health system demonstrated that 20% of obese patients on the standard HIHN achieved anti-Xa levels of ≥ 2 units/mL on first check, greatly exceeding the target therapeutic range of 0.3-0.7 units/mL indicating excessive dosing. In response, on May 11, 2023, a modified dosing strategy was implemented for obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 50 kg/m2 (if no height available to calculate BMI, then weight ≥ 150 kg), including a reduced optional bolus dose of 60 units/kg and a reduced starting infusion rate of 16 units/kg/hr. A post-implementation MUE became necessary to assess the impact of this intervention on heparin anti-Xa levels."
Optimizing Awareness: Effective Strategies for Educating Reproductive-Aged Individuals on Pharmacist-Prescribed Contraception in Indiana,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Rates of unintended pregnancy in the United States have been decreasing, yet remain high, including in Indiana. In the last decade, more than half of the states in the U.S. have adopted legislation allowing pharmacists to prescribe hormonal contraception to address barriers faced by pregnancy-capable people. In Indiana, a statewide standing order was enacted on September 1, 2023, authorizing pharmacists to prescribe self-administered hormonal contraception. These services have expanded access for people capable of becoming pregnant to see their pharmacist for advice, prescribing, and dispensing of birth control. Studies have shown that pharmacists, student pharmacists, and providers are supportive of this legislation and acknowledge the benefits provided by these services. Despite patient interest in this pharmacist-led service, some are unaware that pharmacists are allowed to prescribe different types of birth control. This is of particular concern in Indiana given the recent implementation. The objective of this project is to explore the most desirable strategies for educating pregnancy-capable people in Indiana about the availability of pharmacist-prescribed birth control, with the aim of enhancing the education, awareness, and accessibility of these contraceptive options."

1243 Assessing Attitudes and Implementation of SB112: A Survey of Montana Licensed Pharmacists,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This study aims to assess the current landscape of pharmacy practice and attitudes of licensed pharmacists in Montana related to Montana Senate Bill 112 (SB112), which grants pharmacists the ability to independently prescribe most medications in limited situations and offer test and treat services. We seek to evaluate current and proposed implementation practices among pharmacists and identify barriers and facilitators to successful implementation. Additionally, we aim to determine the need for education and training opportunities to support pharmacists in this transition.

The expansion of pharmacists' scope of practice to include statewide direct prescriptive authority has been adopted by only a handful of other states, with most states permitting similar expansions or point of care testing through collaborative practice agreements or additional certification requirements. SB112 was enacted on May 1, 2023, with the final rule (MAR 24-124-80) going into effect on December 23, 2023. Addressing the statewide healthcare provider shortage through enhanced pharmacist roles can serve to improve patient outcomes and reduce barriers to care across Montana’s rural and underserved populations, but the subsequent impacts of this policy change on pharmacy practice have not been assessed."

Historically, Poison Centers in the United States have served as a valuable resource for both health care providers and the public, providing poison information and toxicological recommendations 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Through calling the poison center, both health care providers and the public can receive information on toxicity of exposures, at-home management measures, and/or hospital referrals and consultations. The Pittsburgh Poison Center currently serves 44 Pennsylvania counties at no cost, receiving approximately 100,000 requests for poison information from the general public and medical professionals each year. In recent history, trends suggest a gap in utilization of these services from young adults. This study will investigate how patients prefer to seek health information, currently interact with the Poison Center, and how different communication channels could impact how and when they engage with the Poison Center."

1141 Investigating the Pharmacist Impact on Diabetes Distress and HbA1c: A Study on a Novel Pharmacist Consultation Model Intervening on Diabetes Distress,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Diabetes distress is a term used to describe the significant emotional burden that affects many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. High levels of distress can lead to poor self-management and suboptimal glycemic control. Current diabetes self-management education (DSME) programs provide valuable education on how to cope with diabetes distress but may not completely address all aspects of diabetes management related to diabetes distress. Several strategies have been suggested to complement diabetes education to reduce diabetes distress, including motivational interviewing, goal setting, and patient-centered communication. However, implementing a robust solution to address diabetes distress can be challenging in a busy medical practice.
Emerging evidence suggests that adding a pharmacist to the healthcare team may reduce diabetes distress. In addition to sharing the additional workload required of implementing a program to reduce diabetes distress, pharmacists also possess expertise in managing medication– including simplifying medication regimens to improve adherence and reduce diabetes distress. However, although research has begun to explore the pharmacist's role as a diabetes educator, the impact of pharmacist-led education with medication management services on reducing diabetes distress has not yet been investigated in a prospective, interventional research design.
This study aims to fill this gap by introducing personalized pharmacist consultations focused on the highest sources of diabetes distress. The objective is to assess the effectiveness of one-on-one pharmacist consultations on reducing diabetes distress compared to standard DSME classes."
1325 Evaluation of Social Determinants of Health Assessment Models in Community Pharmacy,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of various community pharmacy-based models for evaluating social determinants of health (SDoH). SDoH are the environmental conditions where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age. SDoH has a major impact on people’s overall health, well-being, and quality of life. Currently, there is no universally validated SDoH screening tool is accepted across all healthcare settings. Many studies outline the importance of primary care providers in identifying social needs as they are often a natural point of integration among clinical care, public health, behavioral health, and community-based services. While primary care providers play a crucial role in bridging various services, incorporating an SDoH screening into pharmacy practice offers patients’ the ability to be assessed regularly as more visits occur in the pharmacy. The primary objective is to compare the effectiveness of community pharmacy administered SDoH assessment models. The secondary objectives are to evaluate patient declination reasons for SDoH assistance, compare the pharmacy model for completing SDoH assessments with the community’s social vulnerability index (SVI) score, and evaluate change in pharmacy personnel knowledge, confidence, and competence in SDoH assessments."

Preceptors play a vital role in the training of student pharmacists, with IPPEs and APPEs comprising approximately 30% of Doctor of Pharmacy curricula.1. Maintaining an adequate and diverse preceptor pool is challenging for many pharmacy schools. Previous studies explored motivators for precepting across health professions, but comprehensive research on self-identified motivators specific to pharmacist preceptors is limited. The secondary objective of this study is to compare differences in preceptors' motivations to precept based on preceptor characteristics and demographics."
1064 Student Perceptions on Advocacy in Pharmacy,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The intended purpose of this study is to assess pharmacy students' understanding of advocacy and their expectation of the incorporation of the topic within didactic courses and organizations. Pharmacist’s engagement in current policies such as scope of practice and legislation are imperative, therefore having an understanding of pharmacy student’s barriers and apprehensiveness to advocacy should be addressed to further the profession. Although there are studies on student's perceptions and understanding of advocacy in elective courses, there are not any evaluating all students enrolled at a college of pharmacy. If the gaps of incorporating advocacy within the institution are identified, it opens the possibilities for creating strategies and enacting change to increase advocacy, as well as share findings with other universities who may find similar trends."

The current RCP system for technetium-99m labeled red blood cells (Ultratag® Curium) consists of using a centrifuge. Because a centrifuge is not equipment normally found in a nuclear medicine department or nuclear physician’s office, our facility evaluated concomitant use of the Clamshell superhydrophobic plasma separator (Liu, C, University of Connecticut, UConn Health-YouTube video) and the VividTM Plasma Separation membrane (Asymmetric polysulfone GR #T9EXPPA0200S00R, Pall, Ann Arbor, MI). The Clamshell superhydrophobic plasma separator could separate approximately 65 μL of plasma from 200 μL of whole blood (finger prick blood volume). In addition, it could be fabricated by 3D printing (e.g., Formlabs 3D printers) making it very easy and accessible for RCP testing."
1250 Assessment of the clinical impact primary care population health pharmacists had on patients enrolled into CCM vs patients not enrolled in CCM,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to evaluate clinically significant changes of reaching guidelines directed therapeutic goals for at least one of the chronic care management disease states for patients enrolled in chronic care management (CCM) vs. those eligible but not enrolled.  Clinically significant changes are further defined as: for patients with diabetes, obtaining A1C <7%, for patients with hypertension, obtaining a systolic blood pressure (SBP) <130, and initiation or adjustment of statin therapy based on patients' low-density lipoprotein (LDL) goal of achieving LDL <100 or <70 based on cardiovascular history. 500 patients included in the study are adults aged eighteen years or older who have been referred with two or more chronic disease states and offered CCM services by Duke primary care population health pharmacists between January 1, 2021 to May 31, 2024 as this is when CCM was initiated within the clinic space. 

CCM was developed January 1, 2015 as a non-visit-based payment service provided by Medicare Fee-For-Service Part B recipients with two or more significant chronic conditions. These conditions placed the patient at significant risk for death, acute exacerbation, decompensation or functional decline (Alzheimer's disease, atrial fibrillation, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, etc.). Within our Duke Primary Care group, seven embedded primary care population health clinical pharmacist practitioners (CPPs) offer CCM services. The three main chronic conditions managed by the CPPs include hypertension (HTN), Diabetes (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD).  Currently data is limited within the literature exploring pharmacist impact on clinical outcomes relating to patient care for those enrolled in CCM programs. Due to the limited data available, the purpose of our single-center, retrospective, cohort study is to assess the impact primary care population health pharmacist had on those patients enrolled within the CCM program compared to patients eligible for CCM but who are not enrolled. Potential implications of this data can highlight the possible positive impact of enrolling patients in CCM to help reach their healthcare goals and improvements in continuity of care."

1284 Illinois Health Professional Students� Awareness and Perceptions of Community Pharmacist-Provided Clinical Services,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to determine health professional students’ awareness of the clinical services that community pharmacists are permitted to perform by The Illinois Pharmacy Practice Act. Secondary objectives are to describe health professional students’ opinions of patients receiving such services and to identify factors that impact both their awareness and opinions.

Community pharmacists are utilized in a variety of managed care models and have been found to improve adherence and outcomes. Over time, the Illinois Pharmacy Practice Act has expanded the scope of pharmacists’ clinical services. Through high accessibility and expanding scope, community pharmacists could improve access to medical services such as hormonal contraception and rescue medications.

A large hurdle to this access is simply lack of awareness that a service is available through a community pharmacist. A potential solution is providing interprofessional education (IPE) to healthcare professionals as students. Prior research into IPE has shown that students have positive perceptions of interprofessional collaboration after undergoing experiential learning focused on IPE. However, these studies do not go into specifics of what roles pharmacists are allowed and trained to do. Providers are also more likely to work with clinical pharmacists in inpatient or ambulatory settings, distinctly different from community. These limitations could contribute to providers not recommending services provided by community pharmacists when they are otherwise accessible and cost-effective.

The rationale behind this research project is to help determine gaps in knowledge by other healthcare providers about where community pharmacists fit into patient care. The results will point out the areas where awareness is low and services in which prescribers seek more collaboration. In these ways, this project will help bridge the separation between community pharmacists and other providers."
1318 Addressing Social Determinants of Health in People Experiencing Homelessness: Determining Change in Healthcare Access,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objectives of this study are 1) to evaluate the change in insurance coverage rates in people experiencing homelessness (PEH) when community health workers (CHWs) intervene, and 2) to identify the change in insurance benefits usage, including access to a primary care provider (PCP), CalFresh, transportation services, prescription medication benefits, and/or housing benefits.  

Homelessness is an ongoing issue worldwide where PEH are generally associated with a higher risk of poor health outcomes due to limited access to resources. One of the main barriers identified with this population is the lack of addressing certain aspects of social determinants of health (SDOH), particularly healthcare access. PEH often struggle to access care due to limited knowledge in navigating the healthcare system. While many community outreach providers support patients in obtaining healthcare services, barriers to effective care persist due to lack of provider training in addressing SDOH. Having trained individuals with dedicated resources to assist PEH in overcoming these barriers would greatly improve their access to essential healthcare services. 

HOPE Outreach is a pharmacist-led non-profit community outreach program that aims to close the gap in healthcare for PEH. A challenge faced by providers in this program is patient reluctance to receive care, which stems from an absence of trust and competing priorities for other needs. However, CHWs can play a crucial role in addressing these issues and meeting the various needs of the community through their alignment and shared experiences. Existing literature highlights that CHWs have been effective in improving trust and engagement, which are critical to overcoming barriers in pharmacy services. CHWs have also been shown to facilitate better communication between patients and providers, support medication adherence, and help address cultural barriers to care. These outcomes highlight their potential value in bridging gaps in pharmacy services for PEH. Further investigation is needed to assess whether integrating CHWs into a pharmacy team can improve healthcare outcomes and effectively address the various SDOH barriers."
1042 Digital Health Literacy as a Core Curriculum Course: Necessary or Not?,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This study aims to answer the question of whether digital health literacy should be part of college curricula. Social media is becoming a common source of news and information, especially health information. In September 2020, the World Health Organization and several other global groups released a statement that declared an “infodemic” due to the misinformation and disinformation shared online related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In using social media as a platform, anyone with a device, email address, and wireless connection can share information. No credentials are required, and fact-checking is often limited. Current college students grew up in a digital age, and many do not know a world without social media platforms. A German study concluded that “the use of social media was associated with a low ability to evaluate information critically” and identified a need to “strengthen digital health literacy.” Approximately 42% of participants had great difficulty assessing reliability, and 30.4% had problems finding the information which indicates a potential need for this course and led to this project's primary objective."
1267 Evaluate the implementation of mavacamten in a health system specialty pharmacy,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"This study aims to evaluate the implementation of mavacamten, a novel treatment for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM), within a health-system specialty pharmacy (HSSP) by assessing patient access to the medication and measuring patient adherence. Mavacamten represents an advancement in managing symptomatic oHCM, a condition characterized by abnormal thickening of the heart muscle. Given its potential to reduce heart contraction and the associated risk of heart failure, the FDA requires mavacamten to have Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to monitor its use. This includes mandatory monthly echocardiograms for the first three months and every three months thereafter. Due to its complex management requirements, integration into specialty pharmacy is crucial for effective patient management. Specialty pharmacies play a critical role in managing complicated medications by supporting patients through the process of obtaining the medication, navigating insurance hurdles, and ensuring that adherence protocols are followed. 

This project was launched to evaluate the process and timeline for delivering the medication and initiating treatment, while also investigating affordability and patient adherence. This study is important to the field of cardiology and patients with oHCM as it may provide valuable insights into optimizing the delivery and management of mavacamten. Research on mavacamten has demonstrated substantial benefits for patients with oHCM, such as decreased left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, enhanced exercise capacity, symptom relief, and improved quality of life, while emphasizing the need for careful monitoring to maintain safety to ensure proper management. Even though other studies have demonstrated the positive impact of specialty pharmacy care teams in enhancing medication access and adherence for complex REMS treatments, there is limited data on mavacamten.  

Our objectives are to determine the time to first fill which will be measured by tracking the duration from the date of the initial mavacamten prescription to the first dispensed date, assess patients' access to mavacamten by determining the percentage of patients who successfully receive the medication, and assess patient adherence by calculating the proportion of days covered (PDC)."
1316 The Impact of Cost and Timely Patient Education Regarding Prescription Delivery Services on Delivery Utilization Rates,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study was to address barriers that prevent successful retrieval of medications from the pharmacy by increasing patient awareness of available prescription delivery services and evaluating how delivery costs affect utilization. Medication nonadherence is an increasingly prevalent issue in the United States. Perhaps one of the greatest indicators of nonadherence is when patients fail to pick up their medications from the pharmacy.  Potential barriers that patients often face when tasked with retrieving a prescription from the pharmacy include lack of transportation, inability to leave home, inconvenience, or lack of time. Although most pharmacies provide a prescription delivery option to address such issues, it is largely an underutilized service. A potential factor contributing to the underutilization of prescription delivery is simply the lack of knowledge that such services are available. Cost of prescription delivery may also contribute to its underutilization, as patients who are already experiencing cost as a barrier may be hesitant to pay for delivery."

1134 Assessing the Impact of Certified Pharmacy Technicians Role in Behavioral Health Case Management,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The objective is to develop a workflow that engages pharmacy technicians in behavioral health management. Additional objectives of this project include assessing the change in Short Form Health Survey 12 scores (SF-12) and change in proportion of days covered (PDC) for behavioral health medications. The SF-12 survey is a validated tool used to assess the patient’s mental and physical health’s impact on their quality of life. Over 50 million Americans are experiencing a behavioral health illness such as anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. These individuals encounter barriers in receiving the care they deserve and receiving treatment. These barriers include financial burden, transportation needs, and negative experiences with a treatment provider. Additionally, medication adherence in those with mental illnesses is negatively impacted by factors including stigma surrounding treatment and substance abuse. Since pharmacists are the most widely used healthcare providers, there are many ways they can impact adherence and increase the patient's quality of life. Due to the increase in pharmacists’ duties, many have started to utilize certified pharmacy technicians (CPhT) for broader roles."
"1183 Evaluating Patient and Provider Perceived Effectiveness, Safety, and Satisfaction with Riverside Village Pharmacy�s Clinical Wound Care Service",2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Wound care is a complex, multidisciplinary process involving cleaning, debridement, dressing changes, infection control, patient education, and monitoring, all critical for promoting healing and preventing infection. Chronic wounds can cause pain, immobility, and anxiety, significantly impacting quality of life. Effective wound care requires collaboration among patients, caregivers, home health nurses, and providers, with infection management remaining a key challenge influenced by patient characteristics, wound type, and environment. Pharmacists play a crucial role in infection treatment by selecting appropriate antibiotic therapies, preventing antibiotic resistance, counseling patients on therapies, and collaborating with providers to improve patient outcomes. At Riverside Village Pharmacy, pharmacists have introduced a clinical wound care service where they receive patient referrals, review wound culture reports, and recommend novel topical antibiotic therapies. These therapies involve compounding commercially available antibiotics into a powder formulation and mixing them with gel at established concentrations for direct application to infected wounds. This innovative approach is designed for patients with complex infections requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics and those unresponsive to antimicrobial dressings, antiseptics, and/or oral antibiotics. Patients, caregivers, home health nurses, and/or wound care providers apply the compounded therapy to a patient’s infected wound under pharmacist guidance. Since its establishment last year, the service has supported 398 patients, with an average of 30 new patients being referred each month. While the International Wound Infection Institute Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend antiseptics as first-line treatment for wound infection and limit topical and systemic antibiotics to specific cases, these guidelines provide no direction on which topical antibiotics are recommended and in which patients they should be recommended for. Riverside Village Pharmacy’s novel compounding method lacks explicit guideline endorsement and requires evaluation. Additionally, pharmacists involved in this service do not have specialized training in infectious disease, compounding, or wound care, underscoring the need to research the safety and appropriateness of their recommendations. This research aims to address these gaps by assessing the effectiveness, safety, and satisfaction of the pharmacist-led wound care service. The objectives of this research are to evaluate patient and provider perceptions of therapy effectiveness through reported wound healing, assess therapy safety through reported adverse events, and determine the benefit of pharmacist involvement through reported satisfaction. Evaluating these factors will guide service improvements and assess the potential of this novel compounding approach."
1382 Enhancing Community Health: Developement of a Risk Assessment Tool for Overdose and Suicide Prevention,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Objective: This study aims to create a scoring system for the implementation of future preventative and early identifications regarding a rural county’s overdose deaths and suicides from 2015-2023 and 2022-2023, respectively.

Background: Deaths due to overdose and suicide represent significant public health challenges. The multifactorial nature of overdose and suicide suggests that a variety of biological, psychological, and social factors may contribute to these deaths. Key risk factors may include mental health disorders, substance use, prior involvement with law enforcement, trauma, or abuse. Understanding these risk factors is essential for developing effective preventative strategies. Existing models are limited in scope, focusing on isolated risk factors, rather than a comprehensive consideration of the individual, therefore limiting the effectiveness of prevention efforts. This project aims to develop a scoring system that systematically identifies key risk factors associated with overdose and suicide deaths in a rural county (Primary RUCA code: 6.0; Secondary: 6.1). Currently, there is no scoring system in the county for this purpose, and one has been requested by the health department based on the need to provide a tailored risk assessment tool that healthcare providers, policymakers, law enforcement, and community organizations can utilize to identify individuals at high risk."
1125 Psychotropic Medication Usage in a Residential Treatment Center for Adolescents,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Background:
Limited data exists on the use of psychotropic medication use in pediatric populations at residential treatment centers. A retrospective study by Handwerk et al found that the overall utilization rate for psychotropic medications significantly decreased from admission (40%) to departure (26%) in one such facility (Handwerk et al., 2008, p. 517-525). However, fewer residents in this program were on psychotropic medications at admission than children and adolescents in other residential programs, perhaps due to having older residents than in other programs and a higher proportion of residents referred by family, courts, or social services rather than mental health facilities. 

Research Question and Objectives:
How does the utilization of psychotropic medications change in pediatric patients at a residential treatment center from admission to discharge? The primary objective of this medication utilization review is to comprehensively explore and define medication utilization in a pediatric mental health treatment facility. The secondary objective is to utilize available pharmacogenomic data to demonstrate the value of PGX testing in this clinical setting."

As of 2022, 40.2% of patients have had 3 or more SABA canisters/year which attributed to a 32% increase in risk of severe asthma exacerbations in comparison to patients who received only one to two inhalers/year. Many patients do not perceive any issue with overusing their SABA inhaler; this misbelief is a barrier that will have to be overcome in asthma control. The study objective is to assess the impact of pharmacist-based interventions on the overuse of SABA inhalers in Medicaid patients through an assessment of reported asthma symptoms, exacerbations, and hospitalizations."

1099 Pneumonia vaccination in at-risk diabetic and geriatric populations: A review of pharmacist interventions,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The purpose of this study was to conduct a review of the literature to identify interventions that have yielded higher pneumonia vaccination rates in at-risk individuals age 65+ and people with diabetes who are age 19+. Pneumonia is a large burden to healthcare costs and a large cause of hospitalization, and bacterial pneumonia can be prevented through vaccination. While vaccinations are routinely given to pediatric patients, an additional dose is required for adults 65+ years of age or otherwise immune compromised, including diabetics. Around 11.7% of Americans are diabetic, with ~1.2 million being diagnosed each year. Previous research indicated only 22.2% of Immunocompromised patients and 65% of the elderly population have received the extra dose. With pharmacist interventions, vaccination rates have increased in the general community to prevent a wide variety of illnesses such as Hepatitis, COVID, influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis."
1255 Challenges to Implementing and Maintaining Tobacco Cessation Services in Community Pharmacies,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The research objectives are to identify challenges around initiating and maintaining tobacco cessation services in a community pharmacy setting, and to identify potential solutions to address these challenges. According to the CDC, in 2021 18.7% of adults in the United States reporting using tobacco products. Health complications rising from tobacco use can lead to diminished quality of life, increased healthcare utilization and an increased healthcare burden; and premature death. Community pharmacies have played an important role as an access point for public health initiatives, which was highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic with vaccine administration.  Due to their increased accessibility to the community, pharmacies enhance access to healthcare services. Legislation has authorized pharmacists to provide smoking cessation education, furnish nicotine replacement products, and receive reimbursement for these services. However, it is unknown how many pharmacies are consistently providing this as a service in their communities. Low successful cessation rates indicate current low utilization of smoking cessation services, which leads to investigations on challenges faced by the providers in providing tobacco cessation services, which have yet to be analyzed. The findings from this study will provide objective data needed to identify potential interventions to increase utilization of tobacco cessation services."
1053 Impact of Targeted Outreach on Immunization Rates for ADA Recommended Vaccines in Patients with Diabetes.,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to determine where the gaps of vaccine care lie in patients with diabetes and how targeted outreach by community pharmacists affect vaccination rates. Secondary objectives include specific vaccines administered after patient education, number of appointments made and/or completed, determining if gaps in vaccine care follow a demographic trend, and identification of patient barriers to getting recommended vaccines. Community pharmacists and pharmacy technicians play a major role in disease prevention for the public through vaccinations. Vaccines especially provide benefit to the populations that have increased susceptibility to vaccine-preventable diseases. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends many vaccinations for population health, but even more are recommended for patients with diabetes through the American Diabetes Association (ADA), due to an increased risk of disease. Adult patients with diabetes have influenza hospitalization rates six times that of the general population, along with three times the likelihood of dying from complications arising after contracting the flu. Many other diseases have shown similar outcomes for patients with diabetes. There are several studies supporting the use of routine vaccinations in patients with diabetes, but there are no current studies on where the gap in vaccination care lies for patients with diabetes. Studies have also shown that patient education can significantly impact immunization rates for specific diseases. This study aims to benefit patients with diabetes by identifying where the gaps in care are and determining the effect targeted patient education has on closing those gaps."
1191 Factors impacting community pharmacists' provision of smoking cessation services,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"The primary objective of this study is to measure community pharmacists’ willingness, perceptions, and barriers towards smoking cessation services. Tobacco use, one of the leading causes of preventable death, claims over 8 million lives globally each year, including 480,000 in the U.S. Despite efforts to reduce smoking rates, around 30.8 million U.S. adults still smoke, with only a small percentage utilizing counseling or medications to quit, even though 68% of smokers report a desire to stop. Barriers such as long wait times for medical appointments limit access to smoking cessation support. To address this issue, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have called for improved access to smoking cessation medications, especially for Medicaid patients. Community pharmacists are well-positioned to fill this gap due to their accessibility. As of January 2024, twenty states allow pharmacists to prescribe nicotine replacement therapies, enhancing access to smoking cessation services. However, barriers like time constraints, continuing education requirements, and varying state laws limit pharmacists' ability to provide these services. While some research has been conducted on pharmacists' involvement in smoking cessation, this study aims to address gaps by focusing on the factors affecting community pharmacists' ability to deliver these services across all states."
1164 Rural Residents' Knowledge of Opioids and Safe Storage and Disposal Practices,2025-03-22,13:00:00,15:00:00,Exhibit Hall D - Music City Center,"Background  

Opioid misuse is a significant public health concern in the United States. More opioids are prescribed in rural regions compared to urban areas, and rural residents are more likely to misuse them. Opioid poisonings in rural areas have also increased at a faster rate than in urban regions. Knowledge about safe opioid storage and disposal is essential for mitigating risks associated with opioid misuse. However, less is known about rural residents' understanding of opioids and their safe storage and disposal practices. Understanding opioid knowledge in these communities is essential for developing targeted interventions aimed at improving opioid safety in underserved populations.  

Objectives  

This study aimed to assess opioid-related knowledge, including proper storage and disposal practices, among rural residents. Specifically, the objectives were to (a) evaluate general opioid knowledge and awareness of safe storage and disposal practices, (b) identify sociodemographic disparities in opioid-related knowledge, particularly across race, age, gender, education level, and insurance status."

The secondary objective of this study aims to assess differences in the number of OTPs, patients receiving medication treatment, and overdose events among states with various pharmacist involvement. OTPs are outpatient facilities where patients may receive medications for opioid use disorder, counseling, and behavioral therapies. The authority of states to regulate OTPs is preserved by federal guidelines and states differ in regulations on the physical facilities, administration, and staffing of OTPs. The inclusion of a pharmacist on the multidisciplinary team within OTPs is a best practice but not required. While there is literature that assesses differences in state OTP regulation, data is lacking regarding the role of the pharmacist in OTPs and comparing that participation to outcomes within the state."

Regardless of prior pharmacy work experience, previous research shows that the majority of PharmD students will work in a pharmacy setting by their 4th year in school. There are a variety of reasons for seeking pharmacy work experience, including prior experience, pay, work/internship availability, practice setting, referral. The intent of this study is to assess pharmacy students’ career goals and objectives, understand why they chose the pharmacy setting they currently work in, and how their experience has shaped their career goals thus far. 
Previous studies have analyzed pharmacy work experience as a predictor of performance during pharmacy school and suggested prior work experience improved pharmacy school performance. Another study surveyed 3rd year PharmD students and evaluated their attitudes and opinions towards work experience and concluded that work schedule and career fulfillment had the most significant influence on pharmacy career.  This survey will be distributed to all ACPE accredited PharmD schools nationwide and will more closely evaluate how pharmacy students utilize their work experiences to determine their career path, including staying with their company or pursuing advanced training such as residency programs.
